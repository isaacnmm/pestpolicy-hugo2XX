###  Step 7: Selecting and Preparation of Deck Primer Stain

When selecting your primer stain for the deck, consider factors such as the deck location, the prevailing climatic condition, the type of deck material, the type of finish paint to use, the surface area of the deck, and the number of coats to apply. - Choose waterproof primer when priming deck located in a wet area to prevent peeling and acrylic latex primer for temperate climatic regions.

Moreover, you need to check the UV-rays blockers before purchasing your primer for use in sunny areas.

More so, the deck found in a sunny environment should be primed with lighter/translucent stain to boost the reflection of solar radiations. - Gently, pour the primer stain into an empty bucket - Thin the primer as per the manufacturers instructions - Test the thinned primer over the deck surface to assess the stickiness action

###  Step 8: Re-staining Deck

Further, consider finish paint, which is waterproof (for wet/humid areas), UV-rays resistant (for the sunny environment), and fast-drying.

- Gently, pour finished paint into an empty bucket - Thin the paint sufficiently as per the manufacturers instructions - Stir the paint thoroughly to attain a uniform solvent - Carry out a drop test experiment to ascertain the stickiness level NB: Do not over dilute finish paint the coating layer may be weak and susceptible to wear and tear upon abrasive force.

###  Step 10: Repainting the Deck

- Dip a roller or a paintbrush into a finished paint and load it sufficiently - Cut off excess paint to prevent drains or runs - Apply the paint over the surface back and forth - Repeat the steps above until the entire surface is painted - Leave the first coat to dry as per the manufacturers instructions - Apply the second coat and leave it to dry naturally For a quality finish, its advisable to seal your deck with Thompsons Seal as advised further in this article.

For a deck located in the dusty region, cover the surface with a polyethylene bag to prevent it from dust stains.
