##  **How to choose the Best Tiller for a Woman**

Women gardeners have less muscle compared to men - women [even love tilling without a tiller](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-till-a-garden-without-a-tiller/).That means, garden tillers meant for women should be easy to push. Therefore, therere several factors you should consider when searching for the best tiller for a woman.

###  **1. Use**

Your choice of garden tiller will depend on the task you want to accomplish. A compact and lightweight tiller can work effectively on loose soil but not on hard and compact soil. If you want a tiller for breaking new ground or [work on hard soil such as clay](https://pestpolicy.com/best-electric-tiller-for-clay-soil/),you need a more robust tiller with durable tines and powerful engine.

###  **2. Size**

The size of a tiller determines how easy it is to operate, transport and store. Small tillers have lighter components and are therefore ideal for women gardeners. Also, consider the [tillage angle](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8574606/).However, small tillers wont be helpful if you have a large garden or the soil is hard. Thus, you may have to strike a balance between the size of the tiller and your specific needs.

###  **3. Type of engine**

Garden tillers can either be powered by electricity or gasoline engines. Both of these engines can be found in compact tillers meaning they can conveniently be used by women gardeners. However, most electrically powered tillers come in lightweight designs making them ideal for women. They are also easy to operate and require minimal maintenance. All you need is to be near a source of electric power.

On the other hand, most gasoline powered engines are heavy and may prove hard for women gardeners to push around. They require regular maintenance like oil monitoring, refills, changing spark plugs among others. These are not easy tasks for most women gardeners. So, an electric tiller is perhaps the most ideal for women because of its lightweight and the little maintenance involved.

###  **4. Easy to assemble**

Usually garden tillers come in parts and therefore require careful assembly before operation. They also come with manuals for assembling. Most women are not used to mechanical jobs such as tightening bolts or connecting electrical components. Therefore, your tiller should be easy to assemble so that you dont have to incur costs from assembling services.

###  **5. Easy to use**

Different tillers come with various configurations which make their operation more user-friendly than others. For instance, electric tillers have instant starting mechanisms which allow you to start the engine without delay. With a 4-cycle engine, you dont have to mix oil and gas as in the case of 2-cycle engines. Ergonomically designed handles allow you to operate and manoeuvre the tiller with less tiredness.

###  **6. Safety**

Safety considerations cannot be overlooked when dealing with powered machines. You might incur serious injuries when your body or clothes get into contact with the rotating parts of the machine. Thus, its important to read the instructions carefully when operating your garden tiller. Also consider buying an equipment that is safe to use to minimize the risk of injuries.

Always use the appropriate safety gear such as boots, long pants, and safety glasses.

###  **7. Storage**

Most home owners prefer to store their tillers in their garage. So, you should determine whether you have enough space for storage. You will require more space for gas powered tillers than for electric powered tillers.

##  **Conclusion**

While there are many garden tillers in the market, not all are ideal for operation by women gardeners. Some are too heavy for women to push and require regular maintenance to keep them going. That means, careful selection should be made when buying the best tiller for a woman. The best tiller should allow easy operation and have minimal maintenance procedures.
