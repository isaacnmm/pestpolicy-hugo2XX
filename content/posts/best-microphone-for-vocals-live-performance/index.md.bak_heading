- bucking coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Humbucking_Coil)that's cut the hum brought by the electrical interference. Further, the mic will cancel most of the noise thanks to its capsule (shock

Being a uni
- directional mic, it'll pick sound at the front while avoiding noise from microphones or instruments. I recommend this Pyle PDMIC78 mic for your occasional karaoke night or live performance. However, the mic's internal components aren't of high quality and thus might get damaged on the stage if dropped or when handled roughly.

Compared to different budget vocal mics, the Pyle PDMIC78 will give your superior sound quality

Further, the uni
- directional polar capability ensures that it'll reject the background noise interference. The Pyle

S ennheiser e945 is an equally excellent vocal mic that'll give you natural and clear sound to readily cut through noise mix. It'll be natural and effective either to grungy or clear voice while working best even for loud stages
- a great dynamic microphone,

Sennheiser e945 is a durable, reliable, and rugged vocal mic that has the super
- cardioid pickup pattern, but it's slightly costly. It'll readily isolate the mechanical noise and hence ensure that you won't get noise production. The mics pattern (super
- cardioid polar) enables it to capture the sound of the live vocals excellently while also rejecting most of the environmental noise.

Also, the 350ohms nominal impedance, great frequency response (40 to 18, 000 Hz), and hum
- reducing coil improve its performance. However, Sennheiser e945 has lower proximity effect, and hence it'll give you a sound that'll make less natural
- it's suitable for high
- range and mid
- range voices since it doesn't boost (adequately) its bass frequencies.

The supercardioid e945 mic provides excellent rejection since the proximity effect is compensated and addressed, but the output will vary with your voice's timbre. It'll work great for tenor and female voices while also rendering them to sound fuller. Further, the Baritone singers get some great body, powerful, and clean sound
- which will also be un
- distorted and equally natural.

But bass singers may sound exaggerated
- particularly when they have deep
- voice proximity.

Further, the super
- cardioid pickup pattern is a great feature, which implies that the mic will easily pick sounds from the tool's front while rejecting the sounds coming from various other directions
- which is a great plus for your live vocal performance.
**Pros:**
- Provides excellent boost for the ranges of mid
- & higher intermediate frequency great for backing or lead vocalists.
- Picks any frequency between 40 Hz up to and 18 kHz.
- Has a shock
- mounted capsule that provides excellent performance even with rough handling
- but this also makes the mic heavier
- Highly durable mic like all other Sennheiser mics
- Sturdy and robust vocal mic build

**Cons:**
- None
