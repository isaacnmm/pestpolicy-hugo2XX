I would recommend this dog brush for cutting the hair thatll be falling off from your dogs dog onto the furniture, floors, coats, and car.

Luckily, this brush wont cut any hair on the topcoat, and thus the dogs undercoat will breathe easily and regulate the dogs temperature. For a dog with heavy hair shedding and particularly during spring or fall, you can use the FURminator deShedding brush about 12-15 times per month. - But, for light hair shedding, you can use the brush for roughly 15 minutes each time and about 2-3 times every week.

- In addition to removing excess dog hair, the FURminator deShedding brush will also remove all the shed coat pieces from the pets skin.
