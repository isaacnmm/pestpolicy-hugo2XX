## **How does Borax Kill Fleas?**
**Method 1:**
As a powder, Borax has no smell and can control fleas by dehydrating them. The borax powder breaks the fleas exoskeletons and enters their body, which leads to dehydration and death.
**Method 2:**
As the flea larvae hatch, Borax dehydrates the fleas outer tissues and kills them. Therefore, Borax stops the flea from hatching.
**Method 3:**
Also, Borax contaminates the food preserves for the flea larvae. The larvae feed on the contaminated food (mainly droppings by adult fleas) and get ripped to death.

## **Is borax safe for cats and dogs (Pets)?**
**First:�**
Did you know there is a difference between Borax and boric acid powders? Most pet owners use the above terms interchangeably, which could lead to dangerous outcomes if one is not keen on the one they use on their dog or cat.
It is essential to know which one, between Borax and boric acid, is the recommended natural flea treatment option. You should also be aware of the safety precautions you should take while using Borax to treat fleas on your cat.
## Borax vs. boric acid powders: which is safer?
Both Borax and boric acid powders are derived from boron. Notably, Borax has mainly been used for glazing and welding and also for pharmaceutical purposes.
As a drug product, Borax is known to act as a fungicide and antiseptic and is utilized to heal eye infections. Boron exists in nature is made up of boron, sodium, and oxygen. However, boric acid is made from Borax mixed with an acid. Both Borax and boric acid can be used to treat pest infections.
**However: **
You should note that Borax is a safer and natural alternative when compared to boric acid. Borax is
safe and not harmful to the human skin or pets
. On the contrary, Borax raptures the fleas skin, absorbs its body moisture and kills it.
Also, Borax has a crystalline structure that allows it to slice the fleas internal organs and thus kills both larvae and adult fleas.

Since Borax is naturally derived from boron, it is considered less toxic to your dog, cat and safer in treating a flea infestation. However, ensure to follow all the product label instructions to avoid accidents.

, very troublesome insects.

**3: Borax weed killer **
 Borax will effectively kill weeds around your home and on the lawn. You will require only to sprinkle some borax on the weeds. Further, Borax will not harm your plants and grass. However, treat the weeds in sections if you have a big lawn.

Diatomaceous earth remains the sea and wetland algae, particularly a type of hard-shelled phytoplankton or plankton. Similar to Borax, DE is mined from underground, and it is a natural
pest control
method. Later, the DE powder is crushed into an excellent powder.
Equally, DE is considered a safe
