I've reviewed the best tiller for roots - including for chopping roots, weeds, or loosen soil and remove the grass with the tiller. A right [tiller](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5543968/)gives you a consistent level and allows a uniform planting depth that eventually provides uniform germination for grass or vegetable.

For small land, you can use manual tillers but motorized tillers- like the [PTO tillers](https://pestpolicy.com/best-pto-[tiller](https://pestpolicy.com/best-tiller-for-breaking-new-ground/)-for-the-money/),are more appropriate for cultivating a more extensive garden, vegetable garden, or lawn.
