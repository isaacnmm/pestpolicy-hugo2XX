## LeafGuard's Warranty
LeafGuard offers a comprehensive and strong warranty, reflecting their confidence in their product:

* **No-Clog Guarantee:** LeafGuard guarantees that your gutters will "never clog" for as long as you own your home. If they do clog, LeafGuard promises to **clean them for free**. This is a significant commitment.

* **Lifetime Finish Warranty (ScratchGuard Paint Finish):** The patented ScratchGuard paint finish on LeafGuard gutters is warranted not to blister, flake, chip, crack, peel, split, rot, red rust, or structurally deteriorate as a direct result of manufacturing defects under ordinary wear conditions. This warranty also lasts for the life of the property for the original owner.

* **Transferable Warranty:** The "Lifetime Finish Warranty" is transferable to subsequent owners, though the duration becomes prorated for secondary owners (typically up to 50 years from original installation, with the percentage of coverage decreasing over time). The "no-clog" guarantee generally remains for as long as the original owner owns the home, but its transferability should be confirmed directly with the dealer.
It's always recommended to obtain and review the specific warranty document from your LeafGuard dealer to understand all terms, conditions, and any exclusions.

## Do LeafGuards Gutter Guards Save You Money?
Yes, investing in LeafGuard gutter guards can lead to significant long-term financial savings and benefits:

* **Eliminates Gutter Cleaning Costs:** The most direct saving. You'll no longer need to pay for professional gutter cleaning services (typically $100-$300+ per cleaning, 1-4 times annually), or spend your own time and risk injury cleaning them. This adds up considerably over the years. * **Prevents Costly Water Damage:** This is the most substantial potential saving.
Clogged gutters can cause water to overflow and lead to: * **Foundation Damage:** Water saturation can cause foundation cracks, shifting, and costly structural repairs (tens of thousands of dollars). * **Basement Flooding:** Overflowing water can seep into basements, causing extensive property damage and requiring expensive mold remediation.

* **Fascia and Soffit Rot:** Water backing up in gutters can cause the wooden fascia boards and soffits along your roofline to rot, requiring costly replacement. * **Landscape Erosion:** Uncontrolled runoff can damage expensive landscaping, pathways, and create muddy areas around your home.

* **Pest Deterrence:** By preventing standing water and debris accumulation, LeafGuard eliminates breeding grounds for mosquitoes and nesting sites for insects, birds, and rodents, potentially reducing pest control expenses. * **Extended Gutter Lifespan:** While LeafGuard is a new system itself, its clog-free nature means it avoids the internal corrosion and wear associated with constant debris and moisture in traditional gutters, ensuring its own longevity.

* **Increased Home Value:** A brand-new, high-quality, clog-free gutter system with a transferable warranty can be a significant selling point, potentially increasing your home's resale value.
The initial investment in LeafGuard serves as a long-term insurance policy against potentially far greater costs of home repairs and ongoing maintenance.

Homeowners constantly seek effective ways to protect their properties from water damage, and a primary defense lies in a well-functioning gutter system. However, traditional [gutters](https://pestpolicy.com/all-american-gutters-reviews/)are prone to clogging, leading to overflow that can harm foundations, fascias, and landscaping. This is where [gutter](https://pestpolicy.com/are-gutters-necessary/)guards come into play, offering a solution to keep debris out and water flowing freely.

Among the many brands in the market, **LeafGuard** stands out with its unique one-piece, hooded gutter system.

This comprehensive review will explore the patented design of LeafGuard, its installation process, warranty, and overall value. We'll examine how it compares to competitors and delve into customer feedback to help you determine if LeafGuard is the right long-term investment for your home's protection.

##  How Do LeafGuards Gutter Guards Work?

LeafGuard's system operates on a fundamental scientific principle known as **liquid adhesion** (also called surface tension). Unlike add-on gutter covers or screens, LeafGuard is a **one-piece, seamless gutter and cover system**.

Here's a breakdown of how it functions:

1. **Unique Hooded Design: ** The top of the LeafGuard system features a patented, rounded hood that extends over the gutter trough. This hood is an integral part of the gutter itself, not a separate attachment. 2. **Liquid Adhesion Principle: ** As rainwater flows off your roof, it flows onto the curved surface of LeafGuard's hood.

Due to liquid adhesion, the water naturally clings to the curved surface and follows its path around the nose of the hood. 3.

**Water Enters Gutter, Debris Falls Off: ** The water then drops into the gutter trough below through a narrow opening located just beneath the hood's leading edge. Leaves, twigs, pine needles, and other debris, lacking the same surface tension properties, cannot cling to the curve and are propelled off the edge of the hood, falling harmlessly to the ground. 4.

**Heavy-Duty Construction: ** LeafGuard gutters are typically made from aluminum that is 20% thicker than standard gutters, and they feature larger downspouts (30% larger than industry standard) to handle significant water volume. They are supported every two feet with non-corrosive hangers, offering exceptional strength and durability.

This innovative design ensures that only water enters your gutter system, effectively preventing clogs and directing water away from your home's foundation and landscaping.

##  What Services Does LeafGuard Offer?

LeafGuard provides a specialized, all-inclusive service centered around their unique gutter system:

##  How Much Do LeafGuard Gutter Guards Cost?

LeafGuard is a premium gutter protection system, and its cost reflects the quality of materials, the innovative one-piece design, and the professional installation, which includes replacing your existing gutters. The exact price is not a fixed per-foot rate and depends on several factors:

* **Linear Feet: ** The total length of gutters needed for your home. * **Home Size & Complexity: ** Multi-story homes with intricate rooflines (many corners, valleys, dormers), or those requiring specialized equipment for installation will incur higher labor costs. * **Gutter Removal: ** The cost often includes the removal and disposal of your old gutters. * **Geographic Location: ** Labor rates and operational costs can vary by region.

* **Customization: ** While standard colors are available, specific or custom color requests might influence the price. * **Discounts & Promotions: ** LeafGuard, like other companies, may offer seasonal discounts or promotional pricing.

Based on industry estimates and customer reports, LeafGuard typically costs between **$15 and $45 per linear foot installed**. For an average home with 150-200 linear feet of gutters, the total project cost can range from **$3, 000 to $9, 000 or more**. It's crucial to get a personalized, in-home quote directly from a LeafGuard representative for an accurate price for your specific property.

##  Will LeafGuards Gutter Guards Eliminate the Need for Gutter Cleaning?

LeafGuard's core promise is a **"no-clog guarantee, "** asserting that their system will "never clog. " In practice, this means they aim to **virtually eliminate the need for gutter cleaning** for the homeowner.

Due to their one-piece, hooded design and reliance on liquid adhesion, debris is shed away from the gutter opening. Unlike mesh screens that can sometimes accumulate fine particles on their surface (requiring occasional rinsing), LeafGuard's smooth, curved design is intended to allow debris to slide off.

The company is so confident in this promise that their warranty explicitly states they will clean your gutters for free if they ever clog. For the vast majority of homeowners, this means you can genuinely "get it and forget it" and eliminate the dangerous and unpleasant task of gutter cleaning.
