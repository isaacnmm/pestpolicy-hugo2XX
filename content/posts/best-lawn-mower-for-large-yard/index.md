Definitely, when choosing the best lawn mower for large yard, deck size or yard slope must not be your only consideration. Thus, to easily mow your sprawling estate or just a small lot, check the mower reviews below. But which mower type will be best for your plot? - Well, here it is: push [mowers](https: //pestpolicy. com/best-lawn-mower-for-cutting-edges/) ( acre), mowers, with powered wheels ( - acre).

But for yards that are over acre, you'll need a mower that's designed exactly for large yards - it must be fast and powerful. [Zero-turn-radius](https: //pestpolicy. com/[best](https: //pestpolicy. com/best-lawn-mower-with-mulcher/)-zero-turn-mower-for-rough-terrain/) or [riding mower](https: //pestpolicy. com/best-riding-lawn-mower-for-tall-grass/) seem like an overkill for small yards - they'll be inconvenient and costly.

I recommend gas-powered rear-engine rider or a self-propelled mower (wide deck).
