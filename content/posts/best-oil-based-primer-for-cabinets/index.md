Priming the surfaces of your cabinets prior to painting promotes better paint coverage - I recommend using the best oil-based primer for cabinets.

For a cabinet that's stained, you'll require to apply a minimum of two quality primer coats. Compared to oil-based primers, shellac-based primers dry fast and won't have brush marks but not like. The Oil-based primers will work great on the exterior and interior bare or unfinished wood. The primers will seal your porous wood and thus give better coverage.

The primer prevents tannin-bleeding through paint on cabinets made from woods like redwood, cedar.

You can use the primers (with hardened Enamel) on woodwork, metal, windows, and doors.
