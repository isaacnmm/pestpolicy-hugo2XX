Raccoons are clever, resourceful animals that can be a real nuisance when they invade your home or property. Known for their masked appearance and dexterous hands, raccoons often find ways to enter attics, basements, garages, and even inside walls, leading to damage and health concerns.

If you're struggling with a raccoon infestation, this guide will provide you with effective strategies to safely and humanely remove these pesky animals.

##  Why Do Raccoons Invade Homes?

Raccoons are opportunistic feeders and are attracted to areas where food, water, and shelter are readily available. Urban and suburban areas provide them with plenty of opportunities to scavenge, especially when garbage cans, pet food, or compost bins are easily accessible. Raccoons are also known to seek refuge in attics or chimneys, as these spaces provide them with a warm, secure environment for nesting, especially in the colder months.

Common signs of a raccoon problem include: - Noises in the attic or walls, especially at night when raccoons are most active - Droppings or urine stains around entry points - Damaged or torn vents, shingles, or roofs from attempts to enter your home - Tracks or footprints around your property, especially near trash bins or entry points

##  Step-by-Step Guide to Get [Rid](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-brown-recluse-spiders/) of Raccoons

###  1. Identify the Problem

The first step in addressing a [raccoon](https: //pestpolicy. com/how-to-repel-raccoons/) infestation is identifying where they are entering your home. Look for gaps around windows, doors, chimneys, vents, or the roof. Raccoons are known to squeeze through very small spaces, so you may need to inspect these areas thoroughly.

Once you've located the entry points, it's important to check if there are any raccoon nests or young inside. If there are babies, its best to wait until they are old enough to leave before closing the entry points. Raccoons are protective of their young, and removing babies prematurely can lead to dangerous situations.

###  2. Seal Entry Points

After identifying the entry points, the next step is to seal them securely. This will prevent further access to your home. Use sturdy materials like steel mesh, hardware cloth, or metal flashing to cover gaps or holes. Avoid using materials like wood or plastic, as raccoons can easily tear through them.

Be sure to check around your roofline, vents, and chimneys, as raccoons often make their way into these spaces. Also, check if there are trees near the house that raccoons can climb to gain access to upper levels.

###  3. Set Traps

Live traps are one of the most humane ways to remove raccoons from your property. Set up the traps near the entry points or where you've seen signs of raccoons. Bait the trap with food like cat food, marshmallows, or canned tuna, which raccoons find irresistible.

Check the traps regularly to ensure that any captured animals are not left in them for too long. Once a raccoon is trapped, contact a wildlife control expert or local animal services for advice on how to handle the animal. In many areas, it is illegal to relocate raccoons, as they are considered a nuisance species and may carry diseases.

###  4. Use Repellents

While repellents can be effective as a deterrent, they should be used in combination with other methods. There are several types of raccoon repellents available: - **Chemical repellents: **These are often made from natural ingredients like predator urine or capsaicin (the compound that makes peppers hot), which raccoons find unpleasant.

- **Ultrasonic devices: **These emit high-pitched sounds that are irritating to raccoons but are inaudible to humans.

- **Homemade repellents: **A mixture of ammonia, vinegar, or garlic can be sprayed around areas where raccoons have been active to repel them. While repellents can provide temporary relief, they are not a long-term solution and should be used alongside other control methods.

###  5. Remove Attractants

Raccoons are primarily attracted to food sources, so its crucial to eliminate any potential attractants around your property. Secure trash cans by using raccoon-proof lids, and never leave pet food outside overnight. If you have fruit trees, pick any fallen fruit promptly.

If you have a compost bin, make sure its properly covered to prevent raccoons from digging through it. Additionally, keep bird feeders out of reach of raccoons, as they will take advantage of the seeds.

###  6. Clean Up Droppings and Nesting Areas

If raccoons have been living in your attic or basement, they may have left behind droppings, urine, and nesting materials. It's important to clean these areas thoroughly to prevent the spread of disease and to discourage future visits.

Wear gloves, a mask, and protective clothing when handling any raccoon waste, as it can carry diseases like leptospirosis, rabies, and parasites such as roundworms. Disinfect the affected areas with a solution of bleach and water to kill any harmful pathogens.

###  7. Consider Professional Help

If you're unable to get rid of the raccoons on your own or if the infestation is severe, it may be time to call in a professional wildlife control service. These experts have the knowledge, experience, and tools necessary to deal with raccoon problems safely and effectively.

A wildlife control professional can assess the situation, identify all entry points, and implement a comprehensive removal plan that includes trapping, exclusion, and deterrents.

##  Preventing Future Raccoon Infestations

Once youve successfully removed raccoons from your property, its important to take steps to prevent future infestations. Here are some preventative measures: - Regularly inspect your home for new entry points and seal any gaps or holes. - Trim tree branches that overhang your roof to prevent raccoons from climbing onto your house. - Maintain your yard and remove debris where raccoons might find shelter.

- Store food securely and dispose of garbage promptly.

##  Conclusion

Dealing with a raccoon infestation can be challenging, but with the right approach, its possible to safely and effectively remove these animals from your home. By identifying the source of the problem, sealing entry points, and using traps and repellents, you can keep raccoons out of your home. Remember to always consider humane methods, and dont hesitate to reach out to professionals if the situation becomes overwhelming.
