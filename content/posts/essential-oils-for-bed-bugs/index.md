## Essential Oils For Bed Bugs - Top 9 Oils

The effectiveness of lavender essential oil depends on the type of oil you use and how well you use it. Since therere different lavender herb species, its possible to get fooled into buying ineffective products.

- French Lavender (Lavandula dentata)
- English Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia)
- Spanish Lavender (Lavandula stoechas)

## **Alternatives of Essential Oil for Bed Bugs**
### **1. Bed Bugs Steamers**
Steam treatment is one of the best remedies for eradicating bed bugs, including their nymphs and the eggs. However, not all steamers will get the job done.
It would help if you had a high-quality steamer, preferably a commercial steamer. Theyre capable of achieving the required temperatures for destroying bed bugs.
Cloth steamers and carpet cleaners wont reach sufficient temperatures to kill bed bugs. Normally, a commercial steam cleaner is too expensive to be bought and used by a single household (up to $1200).
But, you can hire from local pest exterminators. A steamer works by raising the infested area's temperature to extreme levels (160F-180F).
*How to use a bed bug steamer.*
1. Get yourself an effective steamer from your shop or online. It should produce high-quality steam to create unbearable conditions for the bed bugs.
2. Follow the user manual included in the package to set your apparatus. Remember, this is an expensive gadget. If you dont follow instructions carefully, you might end up destroying your expensive gadget or ruining your floor or carpet. Wrong use might even result in steam burns. But no need to worry; most steamers are quite easy and safe to operate.
3. Begin your operation and bombard your infested places with high-temperature steam. Treat your floor, carpet, bed, bedding, curtain, and any crevices that bed bugs might hide.
4. Remember, the intention here is to kill all bed bugs, nymphs, and eggs. Therefore, try to expose all the affected places to the steam. Do not soak the place with steam. It would help if you also were keen not to cause electric short circuits.
### **2. Bed Bug Sprays**
Bed bug sprays are perhaps some of the
most commonly
used insecticides. They tend to work best when sprayed directly on bed bugs.
Theres a `common misconception that bed bug sprays are not as effective as some alternatives. This can be attributed to the current bed bug resistance to many insecticides.
However, with the right spray, it is possible to
control bed bug
infestation in your house. Normally, therere three types of bed bug sprays depending on the form of the chemical used.
These include aerosol sprays, liquid concentrates, and liquid sprays.
**- Bed Bug Aerosol Sprays**
Bed bug aerosols
are rather meant for residual killing than for instant kill. Unlike contact sprays, aerosol sprays wont kill bed bugs rapidly. However, since they have a longer residue effect, they can continue killing even after weeks.
They are easy to use. You need to shake the can to build up pressure. Then you can spray directly on the infested place. Normally, aerosol cans do not experience pulses between triggers. Plus, when you spray, the insecticide tends to foam on the surface. This gives you a visual display of how the insecticide is spreading.
Aerosol sprays are manufactured using various compounds to allow their application on several surfaces. For instance, some
bed bug aerosols
are ideal, so use on your upholstery. Others are meant for use on wooden surfaces.
**3. Liquid Bed Bug Sprays**
Unlike aerosols, liquid sprays are meant to kill bed bugs on contact. The insecticide evaporates quickly, meaning it has no residue activity. Its trigger mechanism operates just like the sprayer you use to spray your plants.
Liquid sprays give you an efficient way of reaching bed bugs that hide in narrow cracks such as along floorboards and baseboards. This is because the nozzle can be adjusted to make the insecticide come out in a sharp streak.
They dont leave any residual effects that make them ideal for surfaces such as upholstery, bedding, mattresses, sofa set, and kitchen. Its advisable to saturate the infested place with the insecticide, then allow it to dry.
**4. Concentrated Insecticides**
The last type of
bed bug spray
is the concentrated insecticide spray. They are available as residual compounds, contract killers, or one that serves both purposes.
Unlike aerosols and liquid sprays, concentrated sprays take some time to prepare since they require mixed water. Concentrate insecticides are applied with the help of a tank sprayer.
The usage and safety manuals for these sprayers vary depending on the model. They all come with a hand pump for building pressure.
Most of the sprayers come with an adjustable nozzle. This allows you to achieve a narrow stream of the insecticide for use in cracks or crevices. The concentrate insecticide comes with a guide for diluting depending on the intended application.
Once your insecticide is ready, pump a few times until the handle becomes hard. Press the trigger and spray evenly on the infested place.
### **5. Bed Bug Mattress Encasements**
Mattress encasements are intended to vacuum your entire mattress and box spring. Its made of tightly-woven material to
prevent bed bugs from getting inside or out of the encasement
.
When you zip your mattress inside the encasement,
bed bugs that get trapped
inside will neither escape nor breed.
They will eventually starve to death.
Bed bugs that are locked outside
wont be able to get inside. Since the encasement has creases, the bed bugs become easy to find and remove.
Advantages of mattress
encasements in bed bug
control:
*They Keep Bed Bugs Off The Bed*
. If new bed bugs come to your house, they wont have a chance of hiding in the mattress or the box spring. The
bed bugs can only crawl
on the surface where theyre easy to spot and remove.
*Protects New Beds From Infestation*
. When you replace your bed, bed bugs trapped inside the encasement wont come out to hide in your bed.
*Allows You To Retain Your Infested Mattress*
. You dont have to dispose of your infested mattress. Just zip it inside an encasement, and your mattress will be as good as new. This can also prevent the
spread of bed bugs
to other places through discarded mattresses.
*Bed Bug Control Becomes Easier*
. Mattresses and box springs happen to be the most preferred
hiding places
for bed bugs. A mattress encasement
traps some bed bugs
and exposes others for easy eradication.
**6. Bed Bug Powders**
Bed bug powders
provide an easy and effective way to eradicate bed bugs. They are also cheap and safe to use. For this reason, powders are among the most commonly used
[bed bug treatments](https://pestpolicy.com/scabies-vs-bed-bugs/)
.
Bed bug powders vary in their effectiveness and strength. When selecting a powder for
bed bug treatment
, look for the following qualities.
*Effectiveness:*
Consider powders that
kill bed bugs
rapidly and work for a wide range of surfaces.
*Toxicity:*
Many of the commonly used bed bug powders are safe for humans and animals. Be sure to buy non-toxic powders because they dont present to your kids and pets' health risk.
*Durability:*
Most bed bug powders tend to have a long residual activity. So, when you apply the powder, it can kill bed bugs for a long depending on the brand. For instance,
diatomaceous earth kills bed bugs
for a long time if kept dry and as long as its not swept.
*Cost:*
Usually, bed bug powders are not expensive. You can save a lot in the cost if you buy in bulk.
## **Conclusion**
[Bed bug infestations differ](https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bugs-vs-mites/)
in their severity. So, it stands out that no single treatment can successively eradicate bed bugs on its own. Although some essential oils can be used to repel and kill bed bugs, they will not eradicate an infestation.
However, they are effective when combined with other treatments such as steam treatment,
[bed bug sprays](https://pestpolicy.com/harris-bed-bug-killer-review/)
, and powders. More importantly, its advisable to consult a pest expert for advice.
