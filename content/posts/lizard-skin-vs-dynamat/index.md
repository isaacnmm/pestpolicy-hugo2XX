But in terms of quality and effectiveness, Dynamat takes the day.

##  Lizard Skin Vs. Dynamat

###  The plus side of Dynamat

Dynamat, first of all, most is a better option to go for when looking for the perfect sound deadening mechanism. Dynamat is also water-based, which makes it more comfortable in terms of application. With Dynamat, you have a minimal amount of work to put in during the installation. You also have the option of doing it in small phases and do not have to finish the job at once, since none of the sprayings will cause damage to your car.

Dynamat is the most preferred option for a lot of people and has been for quite some time, thanks to its near-perfect ability to lessen road noise. It is also not asphalt-based, which a lot of other sound deadening mats are made of.

###  Cons of using Dynamat

Dynamat is costlier than its other counterparts, so despite its superior quality, a lot of people will still go for other options since they are more affordable.

You also need to be extra careful during the cutting process and have the right tools. Application on small surfaces is not too much of a hassle, but larger surfaces are a bit trickier. It is not capable of covering the cars whole surface. You will most probably need a professional to apply it for you, and this will end up costing you more.

###  Advantages of using Lizard Skin.

The sound deadening abilities of the lizard skin spray are not bad, and many of the reviews from people who have tried it so far are good. Application of the lizard skin spray is not hard; you can do it by yourself and in quite a small amount of time too. No parts are left unsprayed when you use lizard skin, so you are assured of full coverage. Using the Dynamat, as earlier mentioned, involves risking trapping of moisture, causing air bubbles.

You do not run this risk with Lizard Spray since it is a spray and not a mat. You will not risk any injury during application since it does not involve any cutting. Even if you hire a professional to spray it on for you still will end up paying a cheaper cost as compared to Dynamat. Read Also: Headphones for Music Production

###  Disadvantages of using Lizard Spray.

Just like any other spraying process, things can get messy and all over if you do not exercise caution. Lizard spray completely sticks on, so make sure you are super careful with your car paint. Even though application seems more comfortable as compared to Dynamat, it would still be highly recommended to get a professional to execute it for you, unless you are one and have done it before.

It may be cheaper than Dynamat, but that still does not make it super affordable. Prepare your coins.

##  Conclusion.

My two cents? If you have a bit of extra cash to spare, consider getting the Dynamat. It is much better quality, plus it will serve you longer and has more positive reviews. LizardSkin is also a pretty decent choice. Now, it is essential to note that none of these two options will give you the type of soundproof quality that you get in a movie or home theatres.

Hopefully, with this information provided, you are better informed about which sound deadener to go with, lizard skin vs. dynamat, and why.
