If you are having trouble with your tent not being as quiet as you wish then do not threaten as I know some amazing ideas which will help reduce the noise - soundproof a tent.

Noise-canceling Headphones - They do what it says in the name, they cancel out noise and are a great alternative to earplugs especially if you find something on your ear quite uncomfortable. These headphones can be quite expensive but in my opinion are worth it and You can purchase them in various designs which are not to like. Read Also: Headphones for Music Production.

# # Soundproof a Tent

## # 1. Carpeting

One of the cheaper end easiest ways to soundproof would be to lay carpeting down, thick carpets work best absorbing the bass frequencies which travel through the ground.

## # 2. Moving Blankets

Theseblankets are known to be great for absorbing sound and they are not tooexpensive either. All you will need to do is hang them in your tent against thewalls and they will act as a sound barrier.

## # 3. Acoustic Barriers

This material is used in recording studios granting it a great material to use. It can be on the more expensive side but I believe it is worth every penny. When purchasing the material companies size them to room size in a house or studio so you may have to cut the material down to the size of your tent.

## # 4. Building a Structure

Thistip is aimed more for those who will be living in a tent for at least a fewdays and more as building and placing a temporary structure can still take up alot of time. You will need to build and assemble a wooden frame around your tent and attach materials that can insulate sound onto the wooden beans. Read Also: Noise Cancelling Headphones.

## # 5. Destructive interference

The bases of this theory are about using the sound waves from the source to counteract that of another. If you use a speaker and point it to the direction in which the sounds are coming from your sound waves should in effect stop the other noises from reaching your tent. The only downfall to this is that you will need to have noise in order to council out the other noise and depending on the frequencies and volumes it may not always work.
