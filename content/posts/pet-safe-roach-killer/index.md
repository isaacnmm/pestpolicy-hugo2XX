##  How Do I Get Rid Of Roaches Without Harming Pets?

Roaches can be found anywhere but they seem to love warm, moist places like bathrooms and kitchens where food spills happen often. Here we will give some tips on how to get rid of roaches without harming pets? **1. Prevention** Sealing up all entry points like loose-fitting door openings can be an important step in preventing roaches from entering the house. Also, keep your counters and floors clean to avoid attracting roaches.

Do not leave pet food out where a roach can jump in from a surrounding counter. Garbage containers should be kept inside and secure, preferably in airtight containers. Remove clutter like paper, books, and old clothes in your home so that cockroaches will have less of a chance to infest. Also, clean garbage disposals and sink strainers often. **2.

Roach Traps** There are a few different types of roach traps that can be used to capture and kill these roaches.

- One is the glue trap, which you just place in an area where there have been sightings of them (such as under or near kitchen appliances). - They get stuck on this sticky surface when they try to cross it. You can then dispose of the captured bugs by simply peeling off the cardstock backing. Grease bowl traps work by luring roaches in with bait, such as bacon or ham.

They are then trapped by a lip on the bowl and cannot get out so they die of starvation.

These traps should be placed where there is an infestation to cut down on their numbers before you try any other type of trap for catching them. **3. Baits** This type of roach trap uses poison gel baits that do not harm pets but will kill these bugs within hours after coming into contact with it. Roach baits that do not pose a danger to your pets since their ingredients are enclosed in some sealed container.

Put the boric acid roach Trap near corners, cracks, or under appliances where you have seen them. Roach baits work by attracting these bugs and they then eat the bait that contains a fast-acting, slow-killing poison. This gives you time to find out how roaches are entering your house and control them with more efficient methods. **4. Boric Acid** Boric acid is an inexpensive roach killer.

It is generally used as an outer perimeter treatment around the perimeters of homes, apartments, or businesses to prevent pests from entering. It can also be applied inside as bait for German cockroaches only - the borax will not kill other roaches such as American, Brown-Banded, or Oriental Roaches.

- A little borax goes a long way with this natural product that has been shown in various studies to be up to 95% effective against all types of household insects including ants, fleas beetles, weevils, etc. In addition, it's safe on plants and won't harm any pets you may have at your home. This makes it one less thing you need to worry about when it comes to pest control.

- One reason for this is because bugs are highly attracted to its taste due to the sugar content which makes them take it back into their nest where they then pass it onto others making a chain reaction of death from within. **5. Diatomaceous Earth** Diatomaceous earth ("food grade" option) is a natural product made from the fossilized remains of diatoms that are ground up into dust.

Diatomaceous earth can be used around pets to deter roaches, but it needs to be applied often.

But theres still some limited risk for your pet if they go outside or lick their fur after walking on dirt where DE has been applied. Apply the Diatomaceous Earth in the areas where you have seen cockroaches. It will work as a repellant for them and they wont be able to cross it without feeling that their exoskeleton is being scratched by the DE particles.

You can sprinkle enough food-grade Diatomaceous Earth all over your house (in corners or along walls), it should keep roaches away from your home altogether!
