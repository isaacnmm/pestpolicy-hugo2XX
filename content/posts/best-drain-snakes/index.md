## **Buyers Guide - Best Drain Snake**
When shopping for a drain snake, it is common for many customers to become overwhelmed by the many varieties that the market has to offer.
- It is worth noting that price does not always go with quality. So, be keen not to be fooled by shopkeepers who present the pricey products as the best in quality and performance.
- Also, different customers may be interested in different features of a product.
So what you see as the qualifying factor in a product may not be the qualifying factor for another customer. Thus, I find it important to share some of the most important factors to consider when buying a drain snake.
## Considerations**when buying a drain snake**
**1. Cable Length**
Drain cleaners come with varying cable lengths. So, depending on the span of your clogs, the ideal cable should be able to reach them.
- Usually, your cable length will be determined by theplace you livein. Typically, people who live in a single storied house will require a drain unit with a least 25 ft cable, such as Ridgid 41408.
A 25 ft cable will not be the ideal cable for cleaning a bathroom drain on the second floor. You need a unit with at least 25 ft cable length.
**2. Diameter**
A drain snake should slide freely through the drain piping to reach the clogs. That means the diameter of the cable should always be smaller than that of the drain piping.
Experts usually recommend a difference of at least  to 1 between the snake diameter and the pipe diameter.If you dont know the pipe diameter, go for a small diameter.
**3. Auger Mechanism**
Every snake needs a means of spinning the cable through the drain. Turning of the cable is what makes it possible to negotiate curves and penetrate clogs.
Avoid units that lack an auger mechanism. The auger mechanism you opt for should be reliable. Otherwise, you might spend a lot of time unclogging your drain or even retrieving the cable from the drain.
**4. Head Type**
Drain cleaners come with either fixed or interchangeable heads. If you opt for a snake with a fixed head, choose one that will tackle your most frequent clogs.
In the case of interchangeable heads, choose those that are easy to change. Below are the most common types of head types used for drain snakes.
1. **Screw head**: Also known as coil head, this type of head allows you to pull the blockage. This is a powerful head for removing blockages such as paper towels and other related products.
2. **Cutting head**: A cutting head is the most preferred head for blockages that require cutting. Most professional plumbers prefer this type of cable head.
3. **Fixed Head:**This type of head is fixed on the cable and cannot be changed.
4. **Interchangeable Head**: When a drain snake comes with an interchangeable head, it provides you with a way of leveraging different heads to cater to different types of clogs. The good thing is that they are easy to change and do not require special tools to change.
## **How to use the Drain Snakes**
**1.**
We'll take the plumber's snake. Next, I've loosened the thumbscrew, as this will allow me to pull out the snake.
**2.**
Next, we'll pull out the snake and start pushing it into the drainpipe that's clogged. Continue with this process until you meet so relatively high resistance. This resistance means that you've reached the drain blockage or a bend in the pipe. Check
flea foggers
.
**3.**
But you need to be about 6 inches from the pipe opening. Once I meet some resistance, I'll tighten up the thumbscrew. Now, I'll spin the auger bit, and it'll drill through the blockage. To do this, I'll hold the handle while pushing forward.
**4.**
Now, hold at the end and loosen the nut, pull out the drain snake more, tighten the nut again and repeat the process to drill through more of the drain blockage.
**5.**
When you feel that you've drilled through most of the blockage, loosen the thumb screen and pull back the drain snake.
## **Conclusion**
When it comes to drain clogs of all types, a drain snake would be an ideal solution rather than paying for a plumber's services be.
And although there are various drain snakes out there, not all of them are suitable for your type of drain clog.
So, it is recommended that you access your kind of drain clog to determine the suitable drain snake for you.
Always go for a drain snake that fits into your drain pipes. Oversize drain snakes will not do a good job or, even worse, will end up damaging your pipes.
