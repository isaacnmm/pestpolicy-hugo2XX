## Why Do Faucets Leak?
Faucets leak when their internal seals, which are designed to control water flow and prevent drips, wear out or become compromised. Over time, constant use, mineral deposits from hard water, and general deterioration can take their toll on these components:

* **Worn Washers:** Common in compression faucets, washers can harden, crack, or lose their shape, failing to create a tight seal when the faucet is closed. * **Damaged O-Rings:** Often found in disc, ball, and cartridge faucets, O-rings provide seals around moving parts. They can become brittle, break, or dislodge. * **Worn Cartridges:** In cartridge faucets, the entire cartridge unit (which contains the seals and controls water flow/temperature) can wear out.

* **Corroded Valve Seats:** The valve seat is the connection between the faucet and the water supply. Mineral deposits can corrode this area, preventing a tight seal for the washer. * **Loose Packing Nuts:** In some older faucets, the packing nut around the stem can loosen, causing leaks around the handle.

## Identifying Your Faucet Type
Before you begin repairs, it's crucial to identify the type of faucet you have, as the internal components and repair steps will vary.
1.  **Compression Faucets:** * **Appearance:** Two separate handles for hot and cold, which you twist to turn on/off. Water flow increases with more turns. * **Mechanism:** Uses rubber washers to seal against valve seats. * **Common Leaks:** Usually a steady drip from the spout or a leak around the handle.
2.  **Cartridge Faucets:** * **Appearance:** One handle that you move up/down for water flow and left/right for temperature. Water flow is typically on/off with minimal movement. * **Mechanism:** Contains a cartridge (a single unit that controls water flow and temperature). * **Common Leaks:** Drip from the spout or leak around the handle when turned on/off.
3.  **Ball Faucets:** * **Appearance:** A single handle that swivels on top of a rounded cap. Very common in kitchens but also found in bathrooms. * **Mechanism:** Uses a rotating metal or plastic "ball" with slots to control water flow and mix hot/cold. * **Common Leaks:** Often drips from the spout.
4.  **Ceramic Disc Faucets:** * **Appearance:** A single handle that pivots over a wide, cylindrical body. Very smooth operation. * **Mechanism:** Two ceramic discs slide against each other. Holes in the discs align to allow water flow. * **Common Leaks:** Less common, but usually a drip from the spout, or a leak at the base of the spout.

## Steps to Repair a Leaky Bath Faucet (General Guide - Adapt to Faucet Type)
While specific steps vary by faucet type, the overall process is similar.

### 1. Turn Off the Water Supply (Crucial!)

* **Locate Shut-Off Valves:** Underneath the sink or in an access panel behind the tub, locate the hot and cold water shut-off valves. Turn them clockwise until they are completely off. * **Test:** Turn on the faucet to ensure water flow has stopped. This also drains any remaining water in the lines. * **If No Shut-Offs:** If your tub doesn't have local shut-off valves, you'll need to turn off the main water supply to your entire home.

### 2. Protect Your Surfaces

* Place a rag or towel over the drain to prevent small parts from falling into it. * Place another rag around the base of the faucet to catch any drips.

### 3. Disassemble the Faucet Handle(s)

* **Remove Decorative Caps:** Most handles have a decorative cap (often marked H or C) that pops off or screws off. Use a flathead screwdriver or your fingernail carefully. * **Unscrew Handle:** You'll find a screw (usually Phillips) underneath. Unscrew it and lift the handle off. * **Remove Trim/Escutcheon:** Depending on the faucet, there might be a decorative trim piece or escutcheon that unscrews or pulls off. You might need an adjustable wrench for this.

### 4. Access the Internal Components (Varies by Faucet Type)
This is where identifying your faucet type is essential.

#### For Compression Faucets (Two Handles):

* Use an adjustable wrench to carefully loosen and remove the packing nut (the hexagonal nut around the valve stem). * Unscrew the valve stem itself. Pull it out. * At the bottom of the stem, you'll find the rubber washer held by a brass screw. Remove the screw, replace the washer, and then replace the O-ring (if present) around the stem. * Inspect the valve seat (the opening inside the faucet body where the stem rests). Clean any mineral deposits with a wire brush.
If pitted or corroded, you might need a valve seat wrench to remove and replace it.

#### For Cartridge Faucets (Single Handle):

* Once the handle is removed, you'll see the top of the cartridge. * Look for a retaining nut, clip, or pin holding the cartridge in place. Remove it. * Use pliers to gently pull the old cartridge straight up and out. You might need to twist slightly. Note its orientation. * Inspect the O-rings at the base of the old cartridge. If they look worn, replace them. Often, it's easiest to replace the entire cartridge with a new one designed for your faucet model.

#### For Ball Faucets (Single Handle with Rounded Cap):

* Remove the handle and then unscrew the cap (often with a specialized tool that comes with the repair kit). * Under the cap, you'll find the "ball" and a cam and packing washer. Remove these. * Inside the faucet body, there are spring-loaded rubber seats. Pry these out with a small screwdriver. * Replace all rubber components (O-rings, seats, springs) from your repair kit.

#### For Ceramic Disc Faucets (Single Handle, Cylindrical Body):

* After removing the handle and decorative cap, remove the screws that hold the ceramic disc cylinder in place. * Lift out the cylinder. * Inspect the rubber seals/gaskets at the bottom of the cylinder. Replace them if they are worn or cracked. * Carefully clean the ceramic discs themselves. If they are scratched or cracked, you'll need a new disc assembly or cartridge.

### 5. Clean and Replace Components

* Thoroughly clean any mineral deposits or gunk from all accessible parts of the faucet body and the components you've removed (valve stems, cartridge housing, etc.) using a wire brush or old toothbrush. * Apply a thin coat of plumber's grease (silicone-based) to new O-rings and any moving parts to ensure smooth operation and a better seal. * Replace all worn or damaged parts with new ones from your repair kit. Ensure new parts are oriented correctly.

### 6. Reassemble the Faucet

* Carefully reassemble the faucet in reverse order of disassembly. * **Do not over-tighten** screws or nuts, as this can damage components or strip threads. Tighten just until snug. * Ensure the handle aligns correctly and operates smoothly.

### 7. Restore Water Supply and Test

* Slowly turn the hot and cold water shut-off valves back on. * Turn on the faucet and check for leaks at the spout and around the handles. * Turn the faucet off and observe it for several minutes to confirm the drip has stopped. * If a minor leak persists, it might indicate a slightly loose connection (tighten gently) or an issue with a new part.
