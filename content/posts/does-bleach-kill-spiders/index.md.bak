Spiders, those unwelcome houseguests! They often seek refuge indoors during colder months, especially in our cozy heated homes. When we spot them, we scramble to find ways to eliminate them, like considering [bleach](https://pestpolicy.com/does-bleach-kill-bed-bugs/)(Sodium Hypochlorite). **But does bleach really work against spiders?

Indeed, highly concentrated bleach (above 11%) with its potent acidity can effectively exterminate spiders, their eggs, and even other pests like flies when generously applied. ** However, it's important to be aware that bleach is not environmentally friendly due to its high toxicity. When using it indoors, protective gear is essential. Additionally, be cautious about using bleach on hardwood floors or natural materials such as wood and stone.

For a simpler and more efficient spider control solution, consider opting for specialized products designed to eradicate these arachnids, such as spider bait traps and insect growth regulators (IGRs).

##  **Is Bleach Effective Against Spiders?**

###  **a. Bleach's Acidic Power**

Yes, high-concentration bleach is effective against spiders and other arachnids and insects. Its acidity disrupts spider cell activity, leading to their demise.

You can also use bleach to remove webs and create a barrier outside your home to keep spiders away. For targeted applications, a bleach spray with a sprayer works best. Related: Foggers for Spider

###  **b. Chlorine Fumes Poison Spiders**

The chlorine fumes in bleach poison spiders, including dangerous ones like black widow. However, be cautious when using bleach due to health concerns.

Proper dilution is key. Spider death time varies depending on exposure and spider size, ranging from seconds to minutes.

###  **c. Bleach Suffocates Spiders**

Bleach can suffocate spiders and other insects with exoskeletons that use it to breathe.

It corrodes living organisms, including spiders, causing cell disintegration and necrosis. This method is effective within ten minutes of contact. Related: [Spider Bite vs Mosquito Bite? ](https://pestpolicy.com/spider-bite-vs-mosquito-bite/)

###  **d. Bleach's Pungent Odor**

Bleach's strong smell deters spiders from treated areas, much like [peppermint oil](https://pestpolicy.com/does-peppermint-oil-repel-spiders/).However, using bleach may harm beneficial insects and require protective gear to prevent chemical exposure.

In summary, bleach can be a potent spider control solution but should be used carefully, considering its potential side effects.

##  **How to Use Bleach to Get Rid of Spiders at Home**

With nearly 40, 000 spider species out there, it's not uncommon to find them in your bathroom. Luckily, you can use bleach to eliminate them due to its acetic acid properties. Here's what you'll need: **Materials: ** - Vacuum or broom - Water - Bleach - Spray bottle

###  **Step 1: Mix Bleach and Water**

Mix bleach and water in a 1: 3 ratio or use equal amounts if needed. Pour this mixture into your spray bottle and shake it well.

###  **Step 2: Spray the Spiders**

Spray the bleach solution directly on the spiders from a distance of 5 to 10 inches, ensuring you cover them adequately based on their size. Also, target the areas where you suspect spiders are hiding, along with their webs. Don't forget to clean up afterward to remove dead spiders and their eggs.

###  **Step 3: Clean Up**

Clean the treated areas to remove dead spiders and wipe off any bleach residue from various surfaces, including clogged drains.

Be cautious not to use bleach on surfaces that could react negatively with it, such as carpets, fabrics, and sofas. Wear protective gloves to avoid contact with your skin and eyes.

###  **Step 4: Vacuum**

Vacuum the floors and surfaces to remove any remaining spiders and bleach residue. Follow up with sweeping and dispose of the dead spiders in the trash. Clean any surfaces that came into contact with the bleach mixture thoroughly. Be mindful not to inhale chlorine fumes or let the mixture come into contact with your skin or eyes.

##  **Will Bleach Kill Spider Eggs?**

Yes, bleach is effective in killing not only spiders but also their eggs. The bleach mixture, when applied with a spray bottle, can kill young spiders and their eggs. The acidic nature of bleach ruptures the outer layer of the eggs and the exoskeletons of young spiders, effectively eliminating them. **Important Tips: ** - Ensure you spray the bleach solution on spider-prone areas in your home.

- Watch out for hidden spider egg sacs, especially in places like old plant stems, and make sure to treat them with bleach as well. - Seal airtight containers holding food items before using bleach to prevent fumes from contaminating them. By following these steps and precautions, you can effectively use bleach to deal with spiders and their eggs in your home.

##  FAQs About Using Bleach to Kill Spiders

###  1. How quickly does bleach kill spiders?

Bleach takes 10 minutes to 2 hours to kill spiders, depending on their size and bleach concentration. Smaller spiders may die in minutes, while larger ones require more time. Increasing bleach concentration can speed up the process.

###  2. Will bleach eliminate brown recluse spiders?

Bleach can kill brown recluse spiders due to its acidity. However, it's not a recommended insecticide because it can harm surfaces and humans. For effective brown recluse spider control, consider using contact aerosols or chemical treatments like Zenprox or spider foggers.

###  3. Does bleach work against Black Widow and Wolf Spiders?

Bleach can kill Black Widow and Wolf Spiders, but it's not the fastest method. Black Widows are dangerous, so professional extermination is advised. Wolf Spiders, being larger, may take more time to succumb to bleach.

##  Conclusion

In conclusion, bleach can indeed be an effective means of controlling spiders and eliminating their eggs, thanks to its potent acidity that disrupts spider cell activity and can suffocate these arachnids.

The chlorine fumes in bleach also poison spiders, making it a viable option for spider control. However, it's crucial to exercise caution when using bleach, considering its high toxicity and potential harm to the environment. Protective gear is essential, and bleach should not be applied to surfaces that could react negatively with it.

For a simpler and more environmentally friendly spider control solution, specialized products like spider bait traps and insect growth regulators (IGRs) are recommended. These alternatives can effectively target spiders without the risks associated with bleach.
