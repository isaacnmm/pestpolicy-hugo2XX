## # [2. COWIN E8 Bluetooth Active Noise Cancelling Headphone - #2 Pick](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C6CC7TJ/?tag=p-policy-20)

The Cowin E8 Headphone is a classic headphone with easy controls, comfortable pads, and great build quality. I noted that its design-build felt a bit premium (with thicker and larger ear-cups) and durable, but its slightly tight and bulky, which makes it overhang from ones head.
