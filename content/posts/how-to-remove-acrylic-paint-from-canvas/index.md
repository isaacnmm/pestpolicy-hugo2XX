Beside, denatured alcohol penetrates the canvas without affecting the material fabric. For a thicker layer of acrylic paint, isopropyl alcohol is suitable.

###  b. Mineral spirit

You will need to dilute mineral spirit slightly when applying over a thin acrylic paint layer. However, for a thicker acrylic paint layer, a higher mineral spirit concentration is needed for a complete breakdown of paint molecular bonds.

Further, apply acrylic gesso to prime the dry canvas for quick quenching and easier stripping. Mineral spirit is poisonous when swallow and should therefore be stored away from kids and pets. See Also: [Acrylic Paint for Pouring ed](https://pestpolicy.com/best-acrylic-paint-for-pouring/)
