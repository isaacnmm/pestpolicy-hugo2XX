## Types of Rain Gutters
Before diving into installation, understanding the common types of rain gutters will help you choose the best fit for your home, budget, and DIY comfort level.
1. **Sectional Gutters:** * **Description:** These are the most common type for DIY installation. They come in pre
- cut sections, typically 10 to 20 feet long, which are then joined together on
- site using connectors, end caps, and sealants. They are usually made from vinyl or aluminum. * **
**Pros:**
- ** Relatively inexpensive, easy to transport, and can be installed by a homeowner with standard tools. Readily available at home improvement stores.
* **
**Cons:**
- ** More seams mean more potential leak points over time, and they may require more maintenance to keep seals intact. 2. **Seamless Gutters:** * **Description:** Fabricated on
- site by a specialized machine that extrudes a continuous piece of metal (usually aluminum) to the exact length of your roofline. The only seams are at corners and where downspouts connect.
* **
**Pros:**
- ** Significantly fewer leaks due to minimal seams, cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing appearance, generally more durable and longer
- lasting. * **
**Cons:**
- ** More expensive, requires specialized equipment for fabrication and installation, making it strictly a professional job. 3. **Materials:** * **Aluminum:** Most popular for both sectional and seamless. Lightweight, rust
- proof, available in many colors, good lifespan (20
- 30 years). * **Vinyl (PVC):** Primarily for sectional gutters.
Least expensive, easy to cut and assemble, but less durable and prone to cracking in extreme temperatures (shorter lifespan of 1
- 5 years for cheaper grades, up to 10
- 20 for better quality). * **Steel (Galvanized or Galvalume):** Strong and durable, good for heavy snow/wind (20
- 30 years). Can rust if coating is compromised. * **Copper & Zinc:** High
- end, very durable, distinctive appearance, but significantly more expensive and typically professionally installed (50
- 100+ years).
For DIY installation, **sectional aluminum or vinyl gutters** are the most practical choice.

This assumes you are installing new gutters on a prepared fascia board (no old gutters to remove).
**Tools and Materials:**
* Sturdy Ladder * Tape Measure, Pencil/Marker, Chalk Line * Level (4
- foot or longer recommended) * Tin Snips (for gutters), Hacksaw (for downspouts) * Drill/Driver with bits (for pilot holes and driving screws) * Gutter Hangers (e.g., hidden hangers or spike
- and
- ferrule) * Gutter Sections (appropriate length and type) * Gutter Connectors (for joining sections) * End Caps (right and left) * Gutter Outlets (for downspouts) * Corner Miters (inside and outside, if needed) * Downspout Sections & Elbows * Downspout Straps (to attach to wall) * Self
- Tapping Sheet Metal Screws (for downspout assembly) * Pop Rivet Gun & Rivets (optional, for stronger connections) * High
- Quality Exterior Gutter Sealant (silicone or polyurethane) * Caulk Gun * Work Gloves, Safety Glasses
**Installation Steps:**
1. **Preparation and Safety:** * Ensure your fascia board is sound and free of rot. Repair any damaged areas. * Install a drip edge or gutter apron under your shingles if not already present. This crucial metal flashing directs water cleanly into the gutter and protects the fascia. * Clear the work area below the roofline. * **Prioritize safety:** Always use a sturdy, properly positioned ladder. Have a helper to spot your ladder and assist with lifting long sections.
Wear gloves and safety glasses.
2. **Determine Downspout Locations and Pitch:** * Decide where your downspouts will be. Ideally, they should direct water away from high
- traffic areas, windows, and critical foundation points. For long gutter runs (over 35
- 40 feet), you might need a downspout at each end, or one in the middle pitching towards both ends. * **Mark the Pitch:** Gutters need a slight slope to drain. A standard pitch is **1/4 inch of drop for every 10 feet of gutter run**.
* Mark your highest point on the fascia board (e.g., one end of a run). * Measure the length of your gutter run to the downspout location. * Calculate the total drop (e.g., 30 feet run = 3 x 1/4 inch = 3/4 inch total drop). * From your high point, measure down that calculated amount at the downspout end and mark your lowest point on the fascia. * Snap a chalk line between these two marks. This line will guide the top edge of your gutter.
3.  **Install Downspout Outlets:** * At your low point mark, place a gutter section against the fascia. Mark the center of where your downspout will attach. * Use tin snips or a hole saw to cut a hole in the bottom of the gutter section for the downspout outlet. * Insert the gutter outlet into the hole. Secure it with self
- tapping screws or pop rivets (at least 4
- 6 evenly spaced). Apply a generous bead of gutter sealant around the flange *inside* the gutter for a watertight seal.
4.  **Install Gutter Hangers:** * Install the first gutter hanger at the high point mark on your chalk line, firmly screwing it into the fascia board (aim for a rafter if possible). * Space subsequent hangers every 2
- 3 feet along the chalk line. Ensure they are all aligned with the chalk line to maintain the correct pitch.
5. **Assemble and Install Gutter Sections:** * **Cut Gutter Sections:** Measure and cut your gutter sections to length using tin snips for rough cuts or a miter saw with a fine
- tooth blade for cleaner cuts. * **Attach End Caps:** Apply a generous amount of gutter sealant to the inside edge of an end cap and firmly press it onto the end of a gutter section. Secure with rivets (optional but recommended) or screws. * **Connect Sections:** For long runs, join sections using slip connectors.
Apply sealant generously to both ends of the gutter sections that will meet inside the connector. Some systems allow for overlapping and riveting/sealing instead of connectors. * **Install Corner Miters:** For inside or outside corners, use pre
- formed corner pieces. Apply sealant to all connecting edges and secure with rivets or screws.
* **Attach to Hangers:** Starting from the highest point, carefully lift and snap or screw the gutter sections into the pre
- installed hangers, ensuring the top edge of the gutter aligns perfectly with your chalk line.
6. **Install Downspouts:** * Measure the distance from the downspout outlet on the gutter to the house wall, and then down to the ground (or desired discharge point). * Assemble downspout sections using elbows to navigate around eaves and down the wall. Remember that the upper section of downspout should fit *inside* the lower section to ensure water flows smoothly and doesn't leak out.
* Secure all downspout connections with self
- tapping sheet metal screws (at least 2 per connection) or pop rivets. * Attach downspout straps to the wall, securing the downspout every 4
- 6 feet. * Install a downspout extension at the bottom to direct water at least 5
- 10 feet away from your foundation.
7.  **Test for Leaks and Drainage:** * Once all sealant has cured (check product instructions for drying time), run water from a garden hose through the entire gutter system, starting from the highest point. * Observe the flow: Water should run smoothly and quickly towards the downspouts. * Check for leaks at all seams, end caps, and downspout connections. If you find any, dry the area, apply more sealant, and allow it to cure.
