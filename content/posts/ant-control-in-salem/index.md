### # Common Ant Species in Salem

Salem is home to several species of [ants](https: //pestpolicy. com/ant-control-in-federal-way/) that can become household pests: - **Odorous House Ants**: These ants are small, dark brown to black in color and emit a strong, rotten coconut-like odor when crushed. - **Pavement Ants**: Dark brown to black ants that typically nest under sidewalks, driveways, and foundations, but can invade homes in search of food.

- [**Carpenter Ants**](https: //pestpolicy. com/what-attracts-carpenter-ants-in-a-home/): Larger ants that can be black, red, or a combination thereof. They dont eat wood like termites but can damage wood structures by excavating tunnels for nesting.

### # Steps for Ant Prevention

Seal entry points around doors, windows, and utility penetrations with silicone caulk. 2. **Remove Food Sources**: Keep kitchen counters clean, store food in airtight containers, and promptly clean up spills and crumbs. 3. **Trim Vegetation**: Keep tree branches and shrubbery trimmed away from the house to prevent ants from using them as bridges. 4.

**Moisture Control**: Repair leaky faucets and pipes, and reduce moisture around the house, as some ant species are attracted to damp areas.
