## How to Get Rid of Wolf Spiders
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6M_84t3oa4
### 1. Pesticides
Most pesticides and Insecticides in the local market kill wolf spiders and
hobo spiders
by paralyzing them before death takes place.
The toxic chemicals in pesticides/insecticides also inhibit spider's eggs from hatching and further break down their breeding grounds (webs).
- When purchasing your pesticides/insecticides, be careful to check on the spider labels or recommendations for killing assurance.
- Tempo SC Ultra is a good example of an outdoor wolf spider insecticide that kills over 100 other pests. The product is extra concentrated to boost killing power and allows further dilution to form 30 gallons of effective solvent - covers a wide surface area.
When dealing with pesticides/insecticides, be careful since residue left behind may affect your pets or kids upon contact.
### 2. Trap wolf spiders in a container
Wolf spider trap container is an ideal method of capturing one or two spiders. Usually, you need a plastic or a glass container and a piece of cardboard or wood -
spiders have no antennae
.
- Upon spotting a wolf spider, cover it with a plastic container immediately. Then, gently slide a piece of cardboard beneath the container - be careful that the spider may not escape.
- This method encloses the wolf spider and prevents it from crawling or running away. You can easily release the spider far away from your compound - may be in the fields. Don't throw live wolf spiders into a dustbin or garbage pit.
When trapping wolf spiders, wear protective gloves to avoid the case of being bitten in the process. Though wolf spider's bite is less venomous, it may trigger a reaction, for allergic sensitive individuals.
### 3. Boric Acid Solvent
Boric acid solvent, when inhaled by wolf spider, chocks and suffocate it to death in a couple of seconds. The toxic gas blocks the breathing system, thus denying it the oxygen needed for life support.
- Upon contact, boring acid solvent weakens and breaks down the wolf spider's exoskeleton - this action exposes internal tissues, which are further dehydrated leading to death.
During preparation, ensure that the boric acid solvent is super concentrated for excellent action.
### 4. Use an organic pesticide
Unlike
commercial chemical-based pesticides
, organic pesticides are manufactured using a special plant-based solvent (Hexa-hydroxyl), which is a non-pollutant.
Actually, these pesticides won't kill wolf spiders directly; instead, the organic substance destroys all insects in which the spider feeds.
By eliminating the wolf spider's primary source of food; then, you will eventually get rid of spiders in the area.
- Usually, organic pesticides come in powder or dust form - you just need to sprinkle it in an area infested with wolf spiders and leave it for a couple of minutes to act.
The organic substance in the pesticides (Hexa-hydroxyl) is safe for both kids and pets - won't cause intoxication or contact reaction.
### 5. Hunt wolf spiders down
Hunting down wolf spiders is a tactical way of elimination where you physically search for these arachnids in their hideouts. Usually, hunting is successful at night more than daytime due to limited light sources, which eases escape.
- Using a torch, flashlight over wolf spiders hideouts intermittently - this could be at corners, holes, cracks, woods, patches, or shrubs.
- The disc eye shape found in the wolf spiders reflects light at night making them more visible.
Upon spotting the spider, you can opt to kill or capture them alive using a trap. Remember to wear protective gloves when hunting wolf spiders for your own personal safety. Avoid disturbing other animals in the vicinity when hunting.

### 6. Spider Spray
Spider sprays are specific products manufactured for wolf spiders elimination - the product may be chemical-based or organic, depending on the manufacturer or intended area of use.
- Spider sprays come in pressurized and concentrated forms that act instantly upon contact. Indeed, the toxic substances in the spray integrate a quick-acting formulation that kills instantly upon contact.
- Demon Max is a classic example of spider spray that integrates complex chemical formula, which not only kills wolf spiders but also inhibits their re-infestation.
Terro Spider Spray is a market lead spider killer that comes in a 16oz canister and works both indoors & outdoors. Further, Terror Spray instantly kills spiders and other insects such as cockroaches, scorpions, crickets, and ants in the process.
Remember, spider sprays are user-specific, either indoors or outdoors - consider checking the labels before use.
### 7. Place sticky traps around the house
If you suspect that wolf spiders are lurking in your compound or house; then, consider using the sticky traps method. The traps are just cardboard pasted with sticky glue on the surface, which acts as the sticking/trapping agent.
- The idea in this method is that when the wolf spider steps on the sticky surface, it gets stuck and unable to crawl along - this act denies it food leading to death.
- You'll need to prepare or purchase several sticky traps.
Then, lay them down strategically at places you suspect wolf spiders may pass or crawl (it may be your bedroom, garage, kitchen, store, yard, or toilet) and leave them for 5 days or so. Later, come and inspect your trap for any capture.
Any trapped wolf spider should be disposed of far away from the compound. Ensure the sticky traps are placed far from kids and pets whatsoever.

### 8. Wash spiders away
Using pressurized water, from a hosepipe or jet stream, you can wash away wolf spider infestation. Usually, you aim water jet at the spiders' hideouts - the water pushes the spiders out instantly.
- Upon removal, the spiders (plus their eggs) float in water and are easily washed away.
- This method is best for outdoor wolf spiders' elimination.
Also, the drainage through which the washed spiders flow should be sufficiently linked to sewer or septic to prevent re-infestation.
When washing away wolf spiders infestation, wear protective gear (gumboots, gloves, goggles, etc.) for your personal safety.
### 9. Kill the spider with a broom
By using a standard broom, you can strike and kill a live wolf spider - as
they lack wings
. Normally, you need to aim and hit the spider fast before it senses danger.
- Wolf spiders are fast running - they quickly pace to their hideouts as soon as they detect danger in their vicinity.
- Smaller wolf spiders are likely to slip away when striking; thus, making the broom ineffective - you, therefore, need to check the size of the wolf spider before settling for this method.
Alternatively, you can use a solid object or a pair of shoes to hit the spider too. Dead spiders should be disposed of accordingly.
### 10. Rid your yard of clutter and debris
Clutters and debris in the compound or house are possible hideouts for wolf spiders during the day. Heaps of glass, firewood, mulch, bins, compost, or leaves should be cleared from the compound to eliminate breeding grounds for wolf spiders.
- Moreover, objects such as grills, unused toolboxes, stones, empty flower vases among others should be removed or inspected regularly.
When undertaking the cleaning process, wear protective gear such as boots, gloves, overalls, and gloves for personal safety.
### 11. Seal cracks and holes in the outer wall
By sealing cracks and holes on your perimeter wall or house, you will not only keep off wolf spiders from infestation but also inhibit further breeding ground for other insects too.
- Holes and cracks are immediate hideouts for wolf spiders and often than never, they breed in such areas.
- You can successfully seal the cracks/holes using patty or caulk - both indoors or outdoors.
Broken window screens should be removed replaced immediately.
### 12. Remove vegetation from the perimeter of the house
Heavy plant cover (vegetation) in your compound provides ample ground for wolf spiders infestation. Shrubs, thick flowerbeds, and untrimmed grass cover shied wolf spiders and offer suitable breeding grounds.
- By trimming vegetable covers and clearing plant waste in the compound, you will be exposing wolf spider hideouts; thus scaring them away, if any.
It's recommendable to trim grass cover sufficiently and avoid crowded flower beds in your compound.
### 13. Install insect screens
Insect screen in a fine-mesh framework that is firmly fixed at the vent leading to outside. Basically, it's believed that wolf spiders can get into your house through these vents or chimneys as they search for food.
- Therefore, it's important to install screens all over the vents in your house or perimeter wall, in order to prevent wolf spiders from crawling in through these points.
Though expensive, this method works excellently and prevents other insects from your home too.
### 14. Remove or change your outdoor lighting
The presence of light attracts insects such as flies, mosquitoes, moths among others, which are food for wolf spiders. In response, wolf spiders will come to feed on these insects leading to infestation.
- You should swift off lights at night, especially if it's not in use. Install light shades in your place instead of floodlights.
Alternatively, go for sodium vapor light in place of a normal/standard outdoor lighting system. As much as you can, maintain dim light at night since wolf spiders love hunting for food at night than daytime.
## Homemade Remedies for Eliminating Wolf Spiders?
If you are looking for homemade wolf spiders elimination alternative to fix your problem; then, consider the options highlighted below:
### 1. Use of Hexa-Hydroxyl
Hexa-hydroxyl is naturally blended using plant extracts and oil additives to boots sent. The organic substance can be used to kill wolf spiders by spraying or sprinkling over wolf spider-infested areas.
- All you need to do ispeppermint, lavender leaves, and red peppers. Mesh these items in a motor and add little water. Sieve the mixture and repeat the process again.
- You can opt to add Aloe Vera plant to boost the killing action. The solvent extract kills wolf spiders on contact. Further, the toxic gas released suffocates the spiders to death too
Hexa-hydroxyl is also available in the local market too.
### 2. By Using Glue Strips
Glue can be poured along paths suspected to be used often by wolf spiders. Whether office glue or rubber adhesive, provided that the glue has a substantial adhesive force to hold the spider in place; then, you are good to use it.
- When wolf spiders step on the glue, they will get stuck/trapped and starve to death. Remember, you should use glue that is easier to remove without affecting the primary material upon which it's applied.
Alternatively, you can smear a piece of wood with glue and place it in wolf spiders infested area.
### 3. Dish Soap
Highly viscous dish soap act as sticking surface upon which wolf spiders get stuck. However, it's difficult for the spider just to step into dish soap for no reason.
- Therefore, you will need to have spider's bait placed in the dish soap - this could be a moth, housefly, or any other insect eaten by spiders.
- Prepare dish soap sufficiently - add water and stir to form a thick viscous paste. Using a sweep net, capture moths or flies from the fields. Place the dead flies on the dish soap.
Place dish soap in various points where you suspect wolf spider will pass - it may be your garage, shelves, kitchen, or bedroom. Inspect the trap after a day or so to see the presence of trapped spiders.
Scoop and throw away trapped spider. Always refill the dish soap after capture. This method may also traps crawling insects such as ants as well as houseflies.

## What Attracts Wolf Spiders in the House?
Some of the following things could attract wolf spiders to your house:
### 1. Food
Food such as flies, moths, mosquitoes, among others is key attractants for wolf spiders into your house. Usually, wolf spiders will hunt them individually.
- However, in most cases, the spider prefer visiting place where hunting will be less cumbersome.
- Home dustbins or stores are common places where such insects thrive and breed in large colonies. Therefore, wolf spiders often build their webs, which acts as traps.
When wolf spiders realize there is plenty of food in your house or compound, they tend to breed and multiply - they end up building a shelter there.
### 2. Shelter
Wolf spiders love living in a quiet place far from any disturbances. Your quiet house could be such as a serene place for wolf spiders where they would prefer living in.
Moreover, wolf spiders like hideouts that are less inhabited by other insects - like cracks, holes, gaps, shelves, etc. Perhaps your house has room for such hideouts; then, you are likely to find wolf spiders coming to your home.
### 3. Breeding ground
Breeding is critical for wolf spiders as they undertake reproduction life in quiet places far from any commotion.
- Your house, especially the ceiling is a good environment that will attract wolf spiders.
- Pinholes, vents, cracks, and shelves are the suitable breeding grounds for spiders too - if they located such options in your place during their visit; then, chances are that they will breed and live there.
Remember, wolf spiders will build their web before they lay eggs - this could be a physical sign of infestation in your home.
## How to Prevent Wolf Spiders Infestation
Below are some of the wolf spiders preventive measures:
### 1. Clutter Cut down
Remove all old magazines, boxes, dirty clothes, woodpiles, and old flowers vase. By doing so, you will be eliminating any possible hideouts for wolf spiders.
- For your own personal safety, take special care when hunting down spiders.

### 4. Dispose of Cardboard Boxes
Old cardboard boxes should be disposed of to clear room for breeding and future re-infestation.
- Normally, the wolf spiders build webs in old boxes and breed, especially when items are not cleared for a long period.
Clear bushes and thick vegetation in your compound - these acts as breeding grounds and hideouts for wolf spiders.
## Conclusion
