**Processor ** CPU (simply Processor) is the single most critical factor for music production on your laptop. However, clock speed needs to be your first priority (and not the number of cores) notwithstanding that you can still use many threads and cores.

For example, mixer tracks must not be linked as it would also mix their effects and instruments. Therefore, split the instruments to many channels. Further, get an Intel i5 processor or quad
- core processor with high clock speed.

##  Choosing your Best FL studio Laptops

**1. SSD or HDD? Hard Drive & Connection Ports ** I noted that SSD drives ( 1 TB SSD would be optimum) are more effective compared to HDD drives in music production. This is particularly helpful when running VSTs or load samples. However, you should note that the speed of your hard drive does not throttle the functioning of the FL Studio. **2.

ASIO Drivers Support and RAM ** For effective communication between the sound card and your FL Studio DAW, the ASIO drivers are very critical elements.

However, as a pro music producer, you might require to purchase some audio interface (external). I would say that a 16GB RAM would be adequate for handling the FL studio DAW, particularly if you're running many sample
- based instruments.

##  Conclusion

However, make sure your laptop comes with extra free RAM slots to allow future RAM upgrade
- but add RAM in pairs all the time. Laptops have CL9
- 11 RAM. Hence, [frequency]( & channels are not significant in this production.
