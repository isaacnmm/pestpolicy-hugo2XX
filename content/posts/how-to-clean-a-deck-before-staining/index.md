Cleaning and staining a [deck](https://pestpolicy.com/can-i-sand-my-deck-by-hand/)can be a daunting task for many homeowners, but it doesn't have to be.

In this article, we will walk you through the step-by-step process of cleaning and staining a deck, making it easy for even the most inexperienced DIY home renovators to tackle this project - such as *weathered wood deck. * **Step 1: Sweep the Deck** The first step in the deck cleaning process is to sweep the deck to remove any loose debris, such as leaves, twigs, or other small debris.

This will make it easier to see any areas that need extra attention and will also help protect your deck from scratches and damage while you are cleaning it.

A pressure washer uses high-pressure water to blast away dirt, grime, and mildew that has built up over time. It's important to start at the highest point of the deck and work your way down, to avoid pushing water under the boards.

If you don't have a pressure washer, you can also use a deck cleaner solution and a stiff-bristled brush to scrub the deck.

Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions when using a deck cleaner solution.

**Step 3: Allow the Deck to Dry** Once the deck is clean, it's important to allow it to dry completely before staining.

This can take several days, depending on the weather.

Be sure to check the forecast before starting this project, as you don't want to start staining your deck if there is a chance of rain in the forecast.

If you find any, you will need to replace them before staining.

Damaged or rotting boards can weaken the overall structure of your deck and can lead to further problems if left unrepaired. **Step 5: Apply the Stain** Finally, it's time to apply the stain. It's important to choose the right stain for your deck. You can find stains specifically designed for different types of wood, such as cedar or redwood.

Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions when applying the stain. When applying the stain, use a paint roller or brush and be sure to work in sections and overlap your strokes to ensure even coverage.

Allow the stain to dry according to the manufacturer's recommendations before using the deck again. See Also: [pressure-treated wood deck sealer](https://pestpolicy.com/best-deck-sealer-for-pressure-treated-wood/).
