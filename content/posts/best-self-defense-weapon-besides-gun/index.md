In the current time, when most have adopted a more minimalistic life, I am sure youll love a weapon (the tactical knife) that serves more than one purpose in your outdoor activities.

So what should you consider in a tactical knife? Well, like any other weapon, your tactical knife must be strong and have an appropriate length.

This will prevent the tactical knife from breaking while in use, which could expose you to danger from the attacker at the most critical time.

Also, the tactical knife should have the appropriate size to allow easy concealing as you move around in the outdoor or indoor space.

For example, using a knife would require that you get close to your attacker. But, sometimes, you might want to attack from a distance to minimize the possibility of the attacker getting close and personal to you.

In such cases, a reciprocating saw, pepper spray, batons, or sword walking sticks can help you protect yourself in case of a home invasion.
