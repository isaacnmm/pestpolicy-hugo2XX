##  Considerations for Best Riding Lawn Mower for Tall Grass

Ride-on mowers present the perfect solution for tackling large or [for small yards](https://pestpolicy.com/best-riding-lawn-mower-for-small-yard/)with tall grass. - As compared to walk-behind mowers, the ride-on range of mowers delivers exceptional results with very minimal efforts on the users part. There is no one size fits all mower for cutting tall grass. The best ride-on mower will depend on your current needs and requirements.

###  1. Cut width

The mowers ride cutting width is a measure of how wide the tool can cut at one go. - Whereas lighter mowers feature a minimum cutting off 30 inches, larger ride-on mowers can have a cutting width of 50 inches and above. - If you have a relatively small property with hard-to-reach areas and obstacles, a light ride-on mower is more ideal for manoeuvering around tight areas. A larger model is more ideal for bigger spaces with an open layout.

##  2. Fuel capacity

In most cases, the amount of fuel each mower tank can hold is directly proportional to its size. - The key takeaway here is to purchase a tool with the right fuel capacity for your lawn size. - Refueling in the middle of mowing activity is the last thing most professional mowers might want to contend with. While mowers with smaller tanks are perfectly fine for smaller lawns, large lawns require bigger fuel capacities.

###  3. Power transmission

The mowers power transmission allows the tool to transfer power from the engine to the wheels allowing the ride-on mower to move in both forward and reverse directions. - The common modes of transmission are automatic, manual, and hydrostatic. - For the older models, users have to shift between speeds by engaging a clutch. This is highly impracticable while the tractor mower is in motion.

In contrast, a hydrostatic transmission system is deemed ideal for transmitting power from the mower engine to the wheels. It also needs the least amount of maintenance.

###  4. Reverse mow

This is a very useful feature that comes in handy if you are working in a tricky landscape or when you need to go back after missing a spot.

###  5. Warranty

The warranty period is an extremely consideration when you are looking to buy a highly-priced riding lawnmower. - The longer the warranty period the more you can expect the product to serve you. The warranty period can save you hundreds of dollars in replacing broken parts.

###  6. Deck size

The larger the tractor mower deck size, the less time it will take you to get the job done. A mowing deck of 38 is considered ideal for most mowing jobs.

##  Conclusion

If youre shopping on a budget and looking for the best alternative in the market, the Troy Bilt 420cc promises the best value for your money. It is capable of mowing a medium-sized garden with ease and it is incredibly compact.
