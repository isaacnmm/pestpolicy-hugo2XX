It is critical to target the right places using the correct products while trying to control roaches in the house. - Combat is created from carbohydrate-rich attractants, which highly attract roaches. Here're the chemicals professionals use to kill roaches.

##  **1. Fipronil and Hydramethylnon.**

###  a. Fipronil

Some pesticides are highly toxic (and result in health complications) if eaten by pets or kids. This is because the kid's kidneys, liver, nervous system, and brain are still underdeveloped and won't easily handle the harsh chemicals. For example, the [Fipronil](http: //npic. orst. edu/factsheets/fipronil. html) ingredient in roach-killing pesticides is highly toxic - they damage the insect's central nervous system.

If human beings and pets eat it, theyll experience seizures, dizziness, headaches, and sweating.

###  b. Hydramethylnon

Practically, [hydramethylnon](http: //npic. orst. edu/factsheets/hydragen. pdf) works like a great stomach poison for roaches that hinder the bugs' energy generation. This ingredient is common in Combat cockroach Baits. The main technique is to roach killers with this ingredient to work effectively to improve your apartment's sanitation. Thus, you'd need to clean any water pools and food debris that would be lying around your house.

Therefore, also, to increase the chances of the bugs feeding on the hydramethylnon laced bait, your house will also attract fewer new roaches.

##  **2. Indoxacarb and Zeta-Cypermethrin/ Bifenthrin**

###  a. Indoxacarb

Indoxacarb is described as "low-toxicity" (doesn't bring mutagenic or carcinogenic issues) and will control [cockroaches](https: //pestpolicy. com/a-guide-to-preventing-pest-infestations-in-restaurants/) and ants. This ingredient kills roaches through contact or when the bugs eat food or plants laced with the Indoxacarb. A 2008 research reported that one insecticide treatment with indoxacarb kills three roach generations.

Its mode of action is through preventing regular movement go sodium ions through the roaches' nerve cells. This causes paralysis and poor nerve function, and finally, death. Advion Roach Bait Gel is an example of a roach killer that contains the Indoxacarb ingredient.

###  b. Zeta-Cypermethrin and Bifenthrin

The Zeta-Cypermethrin and Bifenthrin ingredients thatll eliminate crawling [bugs, including cockroaches](https: //pestpolicy. com/water-bugs-vs-cockroaches/). - For example, Bifenthrin damages the roaches nervous system, which results in paralysis and, eventually, fatality. Being people and pets safe, these ingredients is appropriate for home use in addition to their features of being odor-free and non-staining.

##  **3. Bifenthrin and Cypermethrin and Imiprothrin**

###  a. Bifenthrin

[Bifenthrin](https: //www. pedchem. com/blogs/news-articles/how-does-bifenthrin-work) is derived from the pyrethrum, and its mainly used against roaches and red fire ants. Like the hydramethylnon above, this Bifenthrin damages the bug's nervous system. The Bifenthrin is contained in Ortho Home Defense Max that we've reviewed earlier in this post on the products.

###  b. Cypermethrin and Imiprothrin

Cypermethrin and Imiprothrin ingredients are readily used in Raid insecticides that target roaches. I noted that these ingredients allow the spray to leave a great smell in your apartment and thus wont have a bad odor.

##  **4. Imidacloprid and MetaActiveTM**

###  a. Imidacloprid

Imidacloprid is an active ingredient in roach killers such as Invicta Gold Gel (about **2. 15%** ), and it has features that make it almost similar to nicotine. Imidacloprid works through ingestion and contact. Nicotine, found in tobacco that hinders stimuli transmission for the bugs' nervous system. This ingredient is mainly used to target German cockroaches.

Imidacloprid will block the nicotinic (the neuronal pathway) that mainly causes acetylcholine accumulation, paralysis, and eventually, the roach dies.

###  b. MetaActiveTM

MetaActiveTM is a potent insecticide ingredient thats great for many roaches, such as Asian, Australian, and German roaches. Its mainly used in the home, commercial, and industry roach control, mostly where the bugs have grown resistant to the available bug baits.

##  Conclusion

The roaches that roam in your house searching for food and water will eat Combat and spread it to the rest of the nests' population. - The[roaches spread the poising through feces](https: //pestpolicy. com/what-does-roach-poop-look-like/), sputum, and carcass.
