## Why Propagate Hydrangeas?

* **Free Plants:** The most obvious benefit  get new plants without buying them. * **Genetic Duplication:** Cuttings and division create clones of the parent plant, ensuring the new plants have the exact same characteristics (flower color, size, form). * **Rejuvenation:** Dividing older, overgrown clumps can rejuvenate the parent plant, encouraging more vigorous growth and flowering. * **Sharing:** A wonderful way to share your favorite hydrangeas with fellow gardeners.

* **Filling the Garden:** Easily create drifts or hedges of your desired hydrangea variety.

### 2. Division (Best for Clumping Varieties)
Division is an excellent method for rejuvenating overgrown, clumping hydrangeas, particularly *Hydrangea arborescens* (Smooth Hydrangea, e.g., 'Annabelle') and some *Hydrangea paniculata* cultivars that tend to sucker.
**When to Divide:** * **Ideal Time:** **Early spring** before new growth fully emerges, or **late fall** after the leaves have dropped and the plant is dormant. * **Nairobi Context:** During the cooler dry season (June-August) or just before the onset of the long rains (February-March) to allow establishment before intense heat.
**Supplies Needed:** * Sharp spade or digging fork * Sharp pruning shears or a sharp knife * Wheelbarrow or tarp * Compost or organic matter * Watering can
**Step-by-Step Instructions:**
1. **Prepare the Parent Plant:** Water the parent hydrangea thoroughly a day or two before you plan to divide it. 2. **Dig Up the Clump:** Using a sharp spade or digging fork, dig a wide circle around the base of the plant, well outside the drip line, to get as much of the root ball as possible. Gently pry the entire clump out of the ground. 3. **Divide the Root Ball:** * Place the clump on a tarp or in a wheelbarrow.

* Examine the root ball for natural divisions or sections with their own root systems and several stems. * **For looser clumps:** You may be able to gently pull apart sections by hand. * **For denser, tougher clumps:** Use two digging forks back-to-back to pry sections apart, or use a sharp spade or knife to cut through the root ball. Ensure each division has a healthy amount of roots and at least 2-3 sturdy stems. 4.
**Prepare New Planting Sites:** While dividing, dig the holes for your new divisions. Each hole should be twice as wide as the new root ball and just as deep. Amend the soil with compost. 5. **Replant Divisions Immediately:** * Plant each division at the same depth it was growing previously. * Backfill with soil, gently firming to remove air pockets. * **Water thoroughly:** Water each newly planted division deeply to settle the soil.

* **Mulch:** Apply a 5-10 cm (2-4 inch) layer of organic mulch around the base of each new plant, keeping it away from the stems. This helps retain moisture and regulate soil temperature. 6. **Care for the Parent Plant:** If you only took a portion of the clump, backfill the original hole with amended soil and water thoroughly.

# Hydrangea Propagation - Expanding Your Garden's Beauty Through Cuttings and Division

Hydrangeas are a beloved staple in gardens worldwide, celebrated for their voluminous, often long-lasting blooms that grace landscapes from summer into fall. Their diverse forms, from the classic mophead and lacecap varieties to the robust paniculatas and smooth hydrangeas, offer an array of sizes, colors, and textures.

Once you've fallen in love with a particular hydrangea, it's natural to want more of them, whether to fill out a border, share with friends, or simply replicate a stunning specimen. Fortunately, hydrangeas are among the easiest shrubs to propagate, allowing you to expand your collection for free with a high success rate.

Propagation not only saves money but also provides immense satisfaction in nurturing a new plant from a piece of an existing one. The most common and effective methods for hydrangeas are **softwood stem cuttings** and **division**. Understanding the optimal timing, gathering the right materials, and following a few simple steps can turn a single hydrangea into many, ensuring your garden bursts with their iconic blooms year after year.

This guide will walk you through the essential techniques for hydrangea propagation, empowering you to create a continuous legacy of these magnificent flowering shrubs.

##  Methods of Hydrangea Propagation

###  1. Softwood Stem Cuttings (Most Common and Effective)

This method is ideal for creating many new plants from a single parent. It works for almost all hydrangea types, including *Hydrangea macrophylla* (Bigleaf/Mophead/Lacecap), *Hydrangea paniculata* (Panicle Hydrangea), *Hydrangea arborescens* (Smooth Hydrangea), and *Hydrangea quercifolia* (Oakleaf Hydrangea).

**When to Take Cuttings: ** * **Ideal Time: ** **Late spring to early summer**, after the plant has put on new growth but before the stems become too woody or begin to set flower buds. The new growth should be firm but still flexible enough to bend without snapping (hence "softwood").

* **Nairobi Context: ** During the main growing seasons, typically towards the end of the long rains (May-June) or early in the short rains (November-December), when new, vigorous growth is present.

Avoid very dry or hot periods.

**Supplies Needed: ** * Healthy parent hydrangea plant * Sharp, clean pruning shears or a sharp knife * Small pots (7-10 cm / 3-4 inches in diameter) * Seedling or cutting mix (a sterile, well-draining mix of peat moss and perlite or vermiculite) * Rooting hormone (powder or gel optional but highly recommended) * Pencil or dibber (for making planting holes) * Plastic bag or dome (to create a humidity tent) * Misting bottle

**Step-by-Step Instructions: **

1. **Select Stems: ** Choose healthy, non-flowering stems from the current year's growth. The stem should have at least 2-3 leaf nodes (points where leaves attach). Avoid stems that are too soft/floppy or too woody. 2. **Make the Cut: ** Using sharp, clean shears, cut a 10-15 cm (4-6 inch) section of stem, making the cut just below a leaf node. 3. **Prepare the Cutting: ** * Remove the lower leaves from the bottom 1-2 nodes.

* If the remaining leaves are very large (e. g. , on bigleaf hydrangeas), cut them in half horizontally to reduce moisture loss and make planting easier. * If using rooting hormone, dip the cut end of the stem into the powder or gel, tapping off any excess. 4. **Prepare the Pot: ** Fill your small pots with moist cutting mix. Make a hole in the center of the mix using a pencil or dibber. 5.

**Plant the Cutting: ** Insert the prepared cutting into the hole, ensuring at least one leaf node is buried in the soil. Gently firm the mix around the cutting. 6. **Water and Create Humidity: ** * Lightly water the potted cutting to settle the soil. * Cover the pot and cutting with a clear plastic bag (supported by stakes so it doesn't touch the leaves) or place it under a clear plastic dome.

This creates a high-humidity environment, crucial for root development. 7.

**Provide Optimal Conditions: ** * Place the potted cutting in a warm spot (around $21^\circ \text{C}$ - $24^\circ \text{C}$ / $70^\circ \text{F}$ - $75^\circ \text{F}$) with bright, indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch the cutting. * Check regularly. Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Mist the foliage occasionally if the humidity tent allows. 8.

**Rooting and Transplanting: ** * Roots typically form within 3-6 weeks, though it can take longer.

You can gently tug on the cutting; if it resists, roots have formed. You may also see new leaf growth. * Once rooted, gradually acclimatize the new plant to lower humidity by gradually opening the plastic bag/dome over a week or two. * Transplant the rooted cutting into a slightly larger pot with general-purpose potting mix. * Grow in a protected location for the rest of the season (e. g. , in a cold frame or sheltered spot).

Plant outdoors in the garden the following spring after all danger of frost has passed.

##  Caring for Newly Propagated Hydrangeas

* **Consistent Watering: ** This is paramount. New cuttings and divisions do not have established root systems and will dry out quickly. Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, especially during their first year. * **Indirect Light/Shade: ** Place new plants in a protected location with bright, indirect light or dappled shade for the first few weeks/months. Gradually introduce them to more light if their species tolerates it.

* **Avoid Fertilizing: ** Do not fertilize newly rooted cuttings or recently divided plants for at least a month, or until you see significant new growth. The fresh potting mix or amended garden soil provides sufficient nutrients initially.

* **Winter Protection (Temperate Climates): ** * Young cuttings started in summer should be overwintered indoors in a cool, bright, frost-free location (e. g. , unheated garage, cold frame) for their first winter.

* Divisions planted in fall should be heavily mulched to protect their still-establishing roots.
