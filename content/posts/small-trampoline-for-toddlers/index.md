##  **Considerations in Small Trampoline For Toddlers**

###  **1. Age and size of kids**

Before buying Trampoline for Toddlers, please go through the following guide and see what you are required to look out for so that you make the most of your trampoline purchase. When choosing a trampoline for your kids, their age and size should be the most crucial aspect. Buy one that is suitable for their age. The market for Kids trampolines has several options designed for toddlers.

Normally, trampolines that are smaller are recommended for kids aged 3 years and above, but some come with an age limit of 3-7 years.

###  **2. Ease of Assembly**

Before making your purchase, go through Amazon customer reviews and assess customer's opinions about the assembling process and ease of installation. Trampolines come in different sizes, and each size has its recommended assembling time. The assembling time might take several hours or a few minutes depending on the size of the trampoline.

However, if the installation process is too complicated for you are advised to employ a professional to do it for you.

Other larger outdoor trampoline models come with higher age ranges like 6 years and above; those are not appropriate for toddlers.

###  **3. Maximum Weight Capacity **

Will, you once in awhile bounce with your kids on the trampoline? Or how many kids will get to play on the trampoline? Ask yourself these questions before making your purchase. This way, youll buy a trampoline that is ideal for your weights. Most trampolines have a maximum weight capacity that they can carry. Most toddler trampolines have a smaller surface size, hence, can accommodate one or two kids.

Similarly, large models can carry more pounds, meaning both kids and adults can play on it.

Always allow a buffer for the weight limit since children grow very fast. Always get a trampoline that is above the weight of your kids. For instance, if your two kids weigh 60lbs each, consider choosing a trampoline with a weight capacity of at least 180lbs, instead of 120lbs.

###  **4. Sturdiness and Durability **

You should buy a product that is built to last and stable enough for you and your kids. It is advisable that you buy a trampoline that will grow with the kids, one that they will use for more years. For example, look at the legs of the trampoline, are they strong enough? Can they help to keep the structure in place?

If you are buying a larger trampoline, then W-shaped legs will be an excellent choice for you, such legs give the trampoline the much-needed stability.

You can also check those models that are secured with t-sockets. T-sockets are known to increase the sturdiness of a trampoline. So, consider checking out those that are fitted with such joints. Another aspect you may want to focus on is the durability of the trampoline. Always ensure you go for features that will prolong the life of your trampoline.

For instance, buy one that contains a UV-resistant cover or one with a galvanized or coated steel frame. Structures made of steel are ideal.

They are usually firm and sturdy and can withstand any weather conditions without getting affected by either rust or fading.

###  **5. Space **

How much space can you spare in your backyard or apartment? Take measurements of the available space and compare it to what manufacturers have given in their installation guide. After taking your measurements, reduce them by a few feet say if your backyard or apartment space measures 20 by 20 feet, you can cut that to maybe 14 by 16 and buy a trampoline with those measurements. This way, your kids will have extra space to climb up or down.

You can also consider buying a trampoline that can be folded. Many mini kid trampolines can be folded up. You can consider purchasing the foldable one if you have limited space. You can fold and store them away once kids are through with playing to create more space.
