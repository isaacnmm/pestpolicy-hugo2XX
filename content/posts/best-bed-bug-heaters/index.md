) without posing risks to your household.
## Key Factors to Consider
### 1. Efficiency
Some products, like the

and
**Dr. Infrared Heater DR-122**

Efficiency in a bed bug heater is crucial because bed bugs can be resilient and often hide in deep crevices. An efficient heater will reach temperatures high enough to kill bed bugs in all their hiding places, including eggs, larvae, and adults.
### 2. Ease of Use
Some products, like the
**ThermalStrike Ranger**
and
**ZappBug Oven 2**
, are user-friendly, with simple setups and easy-to-follow instructions.

When considering ease of use, look for features like intuitive controls, clear instructions, and minimal assembly requirements. A product that is easy to use will save you time and frustration during the setup and operation process.
### 3. Portability
Some products, like the
**ZappBug Heater**
and
**PackTite Portable Heater**
, are lightweight and portable, making them convenient for treating various locations, including hotels or apartments.

Portability is important for those who need to treat bed bugs in multiple locations or who want a heater that can be easily stored when not in use.
