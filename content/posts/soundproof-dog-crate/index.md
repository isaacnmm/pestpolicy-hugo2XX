Did you know that your [dog](https://pestpolicy.com/best-dog-backpack-carrier-for-hiking/)could be stressed or mentally detailed by boom sounds and noises like road traffic, trains, thunder, and fireworks?

Is your dog frequently hiding, howling, barking, drooling, whining, shaking, or panting? Does this really get on your nerves? Well, youll need to soundproof the dogs crate, closet, or room - toreduce the [noise levels](https://ehs.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/decibel-level-chart.pdf).

This will provide safety for your dog automatically whether you're home or away.

##  You Leave Dogs in Bathroom?

I discourage pet owners from leaving any of your dog pets in your bathroom. Sadly, most of us homeowners, that's what we've grown up knowing. But why? Well, bathroom materials are not truly soundproof and thus won't absorb harsh sounds from getting into or outside the space.

August (in Southwestern U. S. ) as thiss when firestorms and thunderstorms will be frequent.
