##  Best Palmetto Bug Killers

If you want to get rid of palmetto bugs without further ado, make use of these effective bug killers to quickly eliminate the creepy crawlies in your house.

###  1. Boric Acid Killer

Using boric acid is one of the most effective techniques to kill palmetto bugs. Its a natural mineral thats able to kill the palmetto bugs. The acid disrupts the digestive system and nervous system of the bugs causing death. The downside is that you wont see its effect right away. Patiently wait for a few days to notice the bugs disappear over time.

###  2. Non-Toxic Roach Traps

Using roach traps is a maintenance-free method to get rid of palmetto bugs. These are quite different from the conventional roach traps. These traps employ non-toxic ingredients to bait the roaches towards the sticky glue surface. These traps should be placed strategically in the kitchen, cupboards and garage.

##  Getting Rid of the Palmetto Bugs

We know youre disgusted by them and dont want to go anywhere near them. Learn ways by which you can free your house of the palmetto bugs before you start seeing them everywhere.

###  1. Roach Glue Traps

Get hold of sufficient amount of roach glue traps and set it in multiple positions all over the house. Its better and safer if you use non-toxic roach traps, especially if youve got toddlers or pets at home.

Some areas where you must place these traps are the kitchen, cupboards, wardrobes, bathroom, basement and garage. The higher the number of traps, the more effective they will turn out to be.

###  2. Homemade Boric Acid Roach Baits

This is definitely the most efficient and cost effective way to deal with palmetto bugs. Although you wont see on the spot results through this method, but we assure you that the palmetto bugs stand no chance against it once theyve consumed it or are exposed to the mineral.

There are two ways through which boric acid works on the palmetto bugs. One of it is through its consumption. In case the palmetto bug digests the boric acid, it would result in the disintegration of its digestive system. Over time, it can lead to even more disruption inside the nervous system of the bug.

The other way is through the abrasive property of the mineral. The boric acid creates an itchy sensation on the exoskeleton of the palmetto bug and it gradually dries out. As the bug is unable to maintain the internal fluid balance, it doesnt last for a long time.

Cover your hands with a pair of gloves and mix different ingredients to make bait for the palmetto bug. Use the boric acid and mix it with a small quantity of flour, sugar and Crisco. The mixture would end up with a sticky dough-like texture. Leave the mixture alongside familiar insect-entry points.

Although boric acid is a naturally occurring mineral, keep in mind that it has a mild level of toxicity. So in case youve got pets or little kids, its best to avoid this method, as accidental ingestion could be dangerous for their safety. There are other safer alternatives available that you can opt for in that case.

###  3. Food-Grade Diatomaceous Earth

This is also an organically occurring white powder and is used to achieve the same result to boric acid. Similar to boric acid, it also comes with a naturally-abrasive property.

Diatomaceous earth has a painful effect on the bugs that come into contact with it. Its sharp microscopic edges feel like stepping on shards of broken glass for them.

Take hold of a sack of food-grade diatomaceous earth and cover the areas where you think palmetto bugs are likely to pass from with sufficient amounts.

Ensure that you dont accidentally get pool-grade powder instead, as its extremely poisonous. Food-grade diatomaceous earth is fairly safer, unless you somehow breathe in large quantities of powder.

###  4. Sealing Cracks and Gaps

Gaps, holes and cracks along the house walls provide an easy entrance point for these insects. Simply seal these entry points and youd notice the number of palmetto bugs decreasing overtime.

Although they are reasonably bigger in size, theyre still somehow able to slip though the little cracks and gaps, and sneak into your house.

Carry out a detailed inspection of your entire house. Check if all the openings are blocked with materials such as caulk. These bugs can even make way in your house via the electrical outlets.

###  5. A Pet Cat

As surprising as it may sound, a pet cat can be a lot of help against the palmetto bugs. So in case you were planning to bring a pet cat home, heres one more reason why you should.

If youve got friends who have cats at home, youd notice that youve never seen palmetto bugs roaming around their houses. Thats because cats do a killer job to get rid of them. Cats not only play with them, but also at times eat them.

We know it sounds disgusting as you can imagine those bugs crawling in unhygienic places. So you should train your cat to only catch the palmetto bugs and not consume them.

##  What Draws in Palmetto Bugs?

As the famous saying goes, prevention is better than the cure, and it fits perfectly for pest control.

Itll be easier for you to get rid of the palmetto bugs if youre aware about the things and conditions that attract them originally. These are a few things that you need to be careful about to keep the palmetto bugs at bay.

###  1. Wet and Warm Environments

Warm and humid environments are an ideal hideout for the palmetto bugs. This is why youd notice that the number of palmetto bugs inside your house start to increase when the weather outside becomes cool and dry.

Create an environment inside your house that isnt preferred by them. You can make use of a dehumidifier as itll help to dry out the inside air.

Inspect your house and look for potential water leakages coming from the broken pipes, broken faucets and roofs. Anything that might cause some areas of the house to become wet; even blocked drains, should be fixed on an immediate basis.

###  2. Leftover Food Wastage

Make sure that all the food scraps in the kitchen is discarded in an enclosed trash bin. Always use airtight sealed containers to store food that isnt placed in the refrigerator, making sure that the palmetto bugs are unable to reach the food. You dont want them feeding on your food and surely wouldnt enjoy the sight of them as toppings on your food.
