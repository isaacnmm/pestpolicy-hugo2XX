##  5. FAQs:

###  Q1: How do I get an accurate price quote for my specific lawn?

A1: The most accurate way to get pricing is to contact both Spring Green and TruGreen directly through their websites or by phone. They will typically ask for your address (to measure your lawn via satellite) and discuss your specific needs to provide a personalized quote.

###  Q2: Are the products used by Spring Green and TruGreen safe for pets and children?

A2: Both companies utilize products that are generally considered safe for pets and children once they have dried. This is a standard practice in the industry. It's always advisable to keep pets and children off the treated area until the product is completely dry, which usually takes a few hours. Always ask your technician for specific re-entry times for the products applied to your lawn.

###  Q3: How long does it typically take to see noticeable improvements in my lawn?

A3: The timeline for results varies based on your lawn's current condition, the specific treatments applied, and environmental factors like weather. For basic fertilization and weed control, you might start seeing a greener lawn and fewer weeds within a few weeks. However, significant, long-term improvements in lawn health and density typically become evident after a full season of consistent treatments (usually 4-6 months).

###  Q4: Do I need to be home when the technicians visit my property?

A4: In most cases, you do not need to be home for the technicians to perform their services. As long as they have unobstructed access to your lawn (e. g. , gates unlocked, pets secured), they can complete the treatment. You will usually receive a service summary or a bill notification after the visit, often via email or a note left on your door.

###  Q5: What if I'm not satisfied with a service or the results?

A5: * **TruGreen: ** Offers a **"Healthy Lawn Guarantee. "** If you are on an annual plan and not satisfied with a treatment, they will gladly revisit your property between scheduled visits to make necessary adjustments at no additional cost. * **Spring Green: ** As a franchise, their satisfaction policy is handled at the local level.

Most reputable Spring Green franchises are committed to customer satisfaction and will work with you to address any concerns and re-treat as needed.

It's crucial to understand the specific guarantee and re-treatment policy of the company you choose before signing a contract.
