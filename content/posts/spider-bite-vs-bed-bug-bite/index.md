##  Spider Bite Vs Bed Bug Bite: Top 7 Difference?

###  a. Physical appearance

Bedbug's bite is usually small and appears as a reddish bump on the skin surface. - The bites are multiple/several/clusters in numbers. Contrary, a spider's bite appears as a single swollen mark. The outlook feature of the bedbug's bite usually leaves fang marks on the surface, especially if it's from species such as the black widow spiders.

###  b. Size of Bite Mark

The size of the bite mark from a spider is usually big/wide (deep fangs can be seen when the bite is still flesh), whereas the size of the bedbug's bite is small - no visible marks at times. Further, the [bedbug's bite](https://health.clevelandclinic. org/need-know-[bed-bugs](https://pestpolicy.com/do-spiders-eat-bed-bugs/)/) may appear like a flat patch on the skin or tiny-pus rashes.

###  c. Number of Bites

Spider leaves one [bite](https://pestpolicy.com/flea-bites-vs-bed-bug-bites/) at a time in a given surface/location, while bedbug carries multiple bites (clusters) in a given surface/point - you will see small shallow marks or swellings on your skin.

###  d. Signs and Symptoms

The outstanding symptoms of a spider's bite include high blood pressure, large swelling, severe pain, paralysis, increased heartbeats, muscle cramping, headache, nausea, and a high breathing rate. Contrary, bedbugs symptoms include red swollen bumps, itchy rashes/blisters (with pus), smelly odor on the surface, and prevalent painful sensation.

###  e. Duration of Bite/would

Upon being bitten, the spider's bite may take one week (7days) to heal, particularly when the right treatment is undertaken. However, the bedbug's bite will take a slightly longer period (one to two weeks - 14 days) to heal under proper medication.

###  f. Degree of Bite Pain

The fact that the spider's bite is deeper and larger as compared to that of the bedbug, the bite mark on your skin is more painful and may bleed profusely for some time. Further, the venom injected into your body worsens human health conditions through intoxication and paralysis this is more pronounced if bitten by some particular species of spiders like the black widow. Bedbug's bite is sharp and short-lived on bite onset.

However, the reddish pimples formed on the skin later generate an itchy feeling that makes one scratch themselves in search of relief.

###  g. Bite Location

Spider's bites are usually found on the fingers, arms, and legs (these are areas bitten mostly), while bedbug bites almost all parts of the body i. e. legs, arms, face, neck, torso, feet, and back. Further, the bedbug bites either appear as a linear pattern or cluster on your skin.

###  h. Severity of Bite

Most spiders bites are known to be more venomous than bedbugs. Black widow and brown recluse spider bites inject hemotoxic venom that impairs the human response system and paralyzes the immune system, thus leading to death with time. Most spider bites lead to large swollen proportions that may lead to severe wounds if not attended to instantly.

On the contrary basis, bedbug's bites never go beyond mere pimples, which appear like red boils with under-skin pus.

Though the bedbug's bite takes a slightly longer time to heal as compared to the spider's counterpart, the intensity of pain is less severe/painful - the pain fades away easily. Read Also: [Fogger for Bed Bugs](https://pestpolicy.com/best-fogger-for-bed-bugs/)

###  i. Biting Time

Usually, bedbugs bite night more than daytime. They tend to be more active in dark than a day they are nocturnal. - The light scares the bedbugs into their hideouts. On the other hand, spider bites during the day than at night. The presence of light is a key factor that helps the spider to locate the biting point (either leg, arm, or fingers). This doesn't mean that a spider can't bite you at night - however, the chances are limited.

###  j. Bite Frequency

Spider normally bites once at a given point (one bite and then runs always), while the bedbug may bite several times on a particular skin surface. - Further, unlike bedbugs, spiders tend to bite only when you threaten them.
