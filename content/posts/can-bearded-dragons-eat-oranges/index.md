** Also, oranges contain more phosphorous than calcium, giving a Ca: P ratio that is incorrect for bearded dragons. These beardies love supplements that have a ratio of calcium: phosphorus ranging from 2: 1 to 3: 1. See other foods for bearded dragons.

##  **Details: Can Bearded Dragons Eat oranges?**

Don't feed [bearded dragons](https: //www. sciencedirect. com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/central-bearded-dragon) (or other lizards) with oranges. Oranges have excessive fruit acid and sugar that'll irritate the digestive system of your bearded dragon. Like other citrus fruits, oranges are very acidic. When ingested by beardies, they can cause severe diarrhea plus dehydration.

Also, the consumption of oranges interferes with the pets Ca: P ratio.

Oranges contain large amounts of phosphorus compared to calcium. - Notably, calcium is utilized in the absorption of phosphorus from the intestines into the bloodstream. The extra calcium required for phosphorus is obtained by the body from the bones. This is a known cause of bone degeneration in beardies which are fed on oranges.

###  **Can Bearded Dragons Eat Orange-Fed Insects?**

A bearded dragon may eat the food, but some may be poisoned, have serious illnesses, or death. - But, is it okay to feed your omnivorous bearded dragon with oranges - maybe some Mandarin oranges? Bearded dragons love eating small creatures like roaches, crickets, and so on. - Since roaches and crickets have an appetite for sugary foods, you can feed them with oranges to enrich their bodies with calcium.

Oranges are particularly very helpful in the thriving and reproduction of Dubai roaches.

- If you feed your bearded dragon on these insects, youll be indirectly giving them the calcium in oranges. - Just like in humans, calcium helps in maintaining the bone health of your bearded dragon. As for the citric acid, the insects digestive system breaks it down to levels that are just appropriate for your beardie to absorb.

###  **Can Bearded Dragons Eat Mandarin Oranges?**

Mandarin oranges are types of oranges that contain less concentrations of citric acid. - However, they are still not far from being harmful to bearded dragons. The sugar content in these citrus fruits is likely to cause diarrhea. - These creatures require a high plant intake in their diet. Plant diet is broken down by beneficial micro-organisms in the beardies gut.

However, optimum activity for these organisms is significantly hindered by the acidity in oranges.

###  **Can Bearded Dragons Drink Orange Fruit Juice?**

The sugar content and acidity remain the same whether you have the raw orange fruit or its juice. - So, orange fruit juice should not be fed to bearded dragons since it can also cause diarrhea and dehydration. Further, bearded dragons have poor drinking habits. Theyre so accustomed to desert conditions that they rarely take drinks when in captivity. - So, you might not bring your bearded dragon to drink orange fruit juice.

###  **Can Bearded Dragons Eat Citrus Fruits?**

Oranges are in the class of citrus fruits and so are grapefruits and lemons. Fruits in this class contain different levels of citrus acid concentration. So none of these should be fed to bearded dragons. The acidity and sugar levels in citrus fruits will readily cause diarrhea in bearded dragons and other lizards. - In addition, citrus fruits contain high levels of oxalic acid, especially on their peels.

It combines with calcium to form an insoluble compound (calcium oxalate). This causes a deficiency in calcium which in turn leads to bone degeneration.

###  **Can Bearded Dragons Eat Oranges Peels?**

Orange peels should not be fed on bearded dragons because they are also very acidic. - They also contain oxalic acid which combines with dietary calcium to form calcium oxalate (CaC2O4). - This leads to lower levels of calcium which is necessary for phosphorous absorption. To compensate for the low calcium levels, the body system uses calcium from the bones which lead to bone degeneration.

###  **Can Bearded Dragons Eat Clementines?**

Clementines are close relatives of oranges derived from the crossing of sweet orange and mandarin. - Since theyre acidic, they should not be fed on bearded dragons. - Their acid content is much less than in oranges. Although clementines are a good source of calcium, phosphorous, and fiber, their acidic content isnt good for your beardie. Like other citrus fruits, it has the potential to cause diarrhea.

In addition, the sugar level and the Ca: P ratio arent good for your beardie.

###  **Can Bearded Dragons Eat Tangerines?**

Tangerines are close relatives to oranges, mandarins, and clementines. - Being a citrus fruit, tangerine also has excessive acidity and sweetness. That rules out its viability as food for bearded dragons. - Tangerines have loose and thick skin with orange flesh and are red-colored. But these fruits have a slightly reduced sourness. But Tangerines are very acidic to be fed to bearded dragons like their staple food.

##  What Do Bearded Dragons Eat in the Wild?

Bearded dragons are omnivorous lizards that'll also eat wild vegetation such as leaves and some fruits. The beardies will feed on vertebrates like lizards plus invertebrates such as beetles and ants. - Beardies will forage the wild vegetation and fruits plus flowers, plants, and small-sized bugs. These pets can go for a long time with no food while conserving energy as they wait for suitable prey including small bugs.

- The wild bugs and vegetation provide the bearded dragons with nutrients plus vitamins to supplement their regular diet. Thus, the captive beardies may need supplements to match such nutritional supply - but you can give them salads and bugs. - Also, make the beardies work a bit to get their food while you're equally providing diet change.

Further, you may simulate wild feeding by providing videos - this also enhances their physical and mental health.

##  **Conclusion**

Bearded dragons must never be fed with citric fruit because they're highly acidic and have high sugar levels. - As much as you want to give a calcium diet to your bearded dragon, you should avoid feeding them with oranges. - The sweetness and acidity of oranges and other citrus fruits arent good for the health of your beardie. Therefore, you should feed them with alternative foods like kale, carrots, collard greens, and other leafy vegetables.
