#### Identifying Common Wasps in Eugene
1. **Yellow jackets**: These aggressivewasps are common in Eugeneand are known for their bright yellow and black markings. They typically build nests underground, in wall voids, or in hollow trees.
2. **Paper Wasps**: These slender, elongated wasps are brown with yellow markings. They often build umbrella-shaped nests under eaves, in attics, or on tree branches.
#### Safety Precautions
Before attempting wasp nest removal, take these safety precautions to protect yourself and others:
1. **Protective Clothing**: Wear thick clothing that covers your entire body, including long sleeves, pants tucked into socks, gloves, and a hat. A beekeeping veil or a cloth over your face can protect against stings on the head and neck.
2. **Perform Removal at Night**: Wasps are less active at night, making it safer to remove nests during this time. Use a flashlight with a red filter to minimize disturbance.
3. **Have an Exit Strategy**: Always plan your escape route before starting nest removal. Move slowly and avoid sudden movements to prevent provoking the wasps.
#### DIY Wasp Nest Removal Methods
For small nests or if you prefer to handle the removal yourself, here are some effective DIY methods:
1. **Soapy Water**: Mix liquid dish soap with water and pour it into a spray bottle. Wait until nightfall, then thoroughly spray the nest until it is soaked. This method suffocates the wasps and is effective for ground nests.
2. **Freezing**: If the nest is small and accessible, you can use a commercial wasp freeze spray to quickly freeze and kill the wasps. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.
3. **Vacuuming**: Using a vacuum cleaner with a long hose attachment, you can suck up the wasps and nest. Immediately seal the vacuum bag in a plastic bag and dispose of it in an outdoor trash can.
