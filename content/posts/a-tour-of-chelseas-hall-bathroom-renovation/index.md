## Demolition and Wall Expansion
The first, and arguably most exhilarating, phase of Chelseas renovation was the demolition. The hall bathroom, originally a cramped 5x8 foot space, felt boxed in and dark. Its outdated linoleum flooring, chipped laminate vanity, and builder-grade fiberglass tub/shower combo screamed for a complete overhaul.
Chelsea's primary goal for this phase was to address the claustrophobic feel. After careful planning and confirming with a contractor that the wall was non-load-bearing, a crucial decision was made: a modest wall expansion. By stealing approximately six inches from an adjacent, oversized hallway linen closet, Chelsea gained just enough precious square footage to make a significant difference. The demolition was dusty and chaotic, tearing down old drywall and exposing the bones of the house.
Yet, with each swing of the hammer, the room literally opened up. Those few inches might seem negligible on paper, but in a small bathroom, they created vital breathing room, allowing for a more substantial vanity and a more comfortable flow within the space. It was the foundation upon which the entire new design would be built.

## Installing the Wetwall
One of Chelseas most innovative choices for the shower enclosure was the **Wetwall panel system**. Moving away from the traditional, time-consuming, and grout-heavy process of tiling, Wetwall offered a seamless, waterproof, and visually stunning alternative that perfectly aligned with her desire for easy maintenance and a modern aesthetic.
Chelsea specifically selected a Wetwall pattern that mimicked the subtle, organic veining of a light gray marble. This choice delivered the luxurious look of natural stone without the sealing requirements and susceptibility to staining. The installation process was remarkably efficient. Large, pre-cut panels were adhered directly to the shower walls, and sealed with a color-matched sealant at the seams, creating a virtually grout-free environment.
This not only expedited the renovation timeline but also promised a future of effortless cleaning. The sleek, continuous surface of the Wetwall panels now provides a sophisticated backdrop for the shower fixtures, reflecting light beautifully and enhancing the overall brightness of the room. Its a testament to how modern materials can elevate both form and function.

Chelsea's hall bathroom renovation is a true masterclass in maximizing a small space and blending diverse design influences. From the strategic wall expansion that opened up possibilities, to the bold choice of a floating navy vanity, the low-maintenance elegance of Wetwall panels, and the charming throwback of penny tile flooring, every decision was thoughtfully made.
The result is a highly functional, effortlessly stylish, and deeply personal bathroom that proves that even the most practical spaces can be transformed into expressions of beautiful design.

Step inside and prepare to be inspired! Today, we're taking an exclusive tour of Chelsea's recently completed hall [bathroom](https://pestpolicy.com/bathroom-remodel-austin/)renovation a project that transformed a small, dated, and somewhat neglected space into a bright, highly functional, and aesthetically captivating sanctuary.

Chelsea, known for her keen eye for design and a courageous DIY spirit, envisioned a bathroom that blended modern clean lines with a subtle nod to timeless retro charm. The journey involved strategic spatial changes, smart material choices, and a dash of personal style that truly brought her vision to life.

##  A New Vanity

With the walls expanded and the new footprint defined, the selection of the vanity became a pivotal design choice. Chelsea opted for a sleek, modern **48-inch floating vanity** in a deep, matte navy blue. This was a bold departure from her previous standard white pedestal sink and was directly enabled by the extra wall space gained during demolition.

The floating design was intentional, contributing to a sense of spaciousness by allowing the floor to extend uninterrupted beneath it, making the room feel larger than it is.

The navy blue color provided a sophisticated anchor for the room, contrasting beautifully with the planned lighter elements. Topping the vanity was a crisp **white quartz countertop** with subtle gray veining, offering both durability and a luxurious feel. Instead of traditional knobs, minimalist black bar pulls were chosen for the drawers and cabinets, maintaining the contemporary vibe.

Paired with a brushed brass single-handle faucet, the vanity became an immediate focal point, marrying functionality with high-end style and ample storage a stark contrast to the old, inadequate setup.

##  Adding Retro Flair with Penny Tile

While the vanity and Wetwall panels leaned into a contemporary, clean aesthetic, Chelsea introduced her desired touch of retro flair through the flooring: **classic white penny tile with dark gray grout**. This choice was a brilliant stroke of design, providing visual texture and a nostalgic charm that perfectly balanced the modern elements.

The small, circular tiles, a staple of early 20th-century bathrooms, created a subtle, anti-slip surface underfoot. The decision to use a dark gray grout was deliberate, not only highlighting the distinctive penny shape but also making the grout lines less prone to showing dirt compared to traditional white grout. Laying penny tile can be a meticulous process, especially to ensure even spacing and alignment, but the effort paid off.

The floor now serves as an understated yet captivating design element, providing a delightful tactile experience and a visual link to vintage aesthetics.

To further enhance this retro feel, Chelsea carefully selected other complementary details. A large, frameless **oval mirror** above the vanity offered a soft counterpoint to the straight lines, reminiscent of mid-century design. The light fixture, a horizontal bar with globe-shaped bulbs in brushed brass, echoed the faucets finish and reinforced the subtle vintage vibe.

Even the selection of plush, deeply textured towels in earthy tones added to the cozy, lived-in feel, completing the blend of modern sophistication and inviting retro charm.
