Blow off dust particle from the metal surface using a blower - Clean the metal surface with soapy detergent and water to remove traces of commercial rust remover and rust particle - Rinse the metal surface with clean water and leave it to dry before priming Commercial stain removers contain chemical compounds that decompose rust on the metal surface into a form that is more comfortable to remove.

###  e. Dish Soap and Fresh Potato

**Items and Tool Required** - Fresh potato and dish soap - Wire brush and a piece of cloth - Grinder and a paintbrush - Waterpoint and an empty bucket - Protective gear and paint scraper **Procedure to Follow** - Put on proper protective gear before stripping paint around rust metal surface for painted metal - Scrub the rust gently using sandpaper to remove think rust layer from the metal surface - Dilute dish soap with water slight and apply over the rust section using a paintbrush - Peel the potato and rub it over the rust continuously until all the rust comes out - Using a soft polishing disc, remove rust debris from the metal surface - Then, clean the metal with water and soap before rinsing it to dryness Fresh potato has chemicals that decompose rust upon contact when rubbing.

The dish soap acts as a catalyst that quickens the reaction when scrubbing. > See Also: > Paint a Metal Interior Door

###  f. Using Baking Soda

**Items and Tool Required** - [Baking Soda](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-remove-paint-from-metal-with-baking-soda/)and Empty container - A wire brush and a paintbrush - Paint Scraper and water point - Protective gear and grinder - Soapy detergent and a piece of cloth **Procedure to Follow** - Put on protective gear respirator, gloves, overalls, facemask, boots, andgoggles - Using a wire brush, scrub the rusted area gently to remove a thick layer from the surface - Clear the rust particleusing a paintbrush to remove - Mix the baking soda with warm water and apply it over the rusted metal using a paintbrush - Leave the surface to cure for 10 to 20 minutes - Then, polish the decomposed rust using an angle grinder until entire rust particles are removed - Soak a piece of cloth in soapy water and wipe the metal surface to clean traced of baking soda and rust particles - Rinse the surface to dryness Baking soda acts instantly upon application and breaks down the paint layer into small particles that are easily removed by a paintbrush or grinder.

A thick rust layer should be pre-cleaned before baking soda is applied. This method is best for light rust thickness.

##  What Causes Rusting to Occur on Metal?

###  1. Presence of Water

Water is the major cause of the rusting process. Oxygen in air, in presence of water, reacts with the iron metal to form rust (hydrated iron (II) oxide). The process of rusting repeats itself continuously until the entire metal surface is damaged. Water enhances rust when in contact with direct iron metal. Usually, oxygen is present in the air, and therefore, the reaction occurs continuously.

Metals that are used in wet areas should be well coated and protected to prevent rusting from taking place.

###  2. High Salinity

When Iron comes into contact with salt content, it starts reacting and forms an oxide that leads to rusting on the surface. Highly concentrated salt accelerates the rusting process upon contact with the metal surface. You will notice that the metal structures found in saline places are more prone to rusting than other places. The protective method in these areas should be carried often to prevent further surface damage or rust occurrence.

Galvanize metal or metal allow should be considered in the saline environment to reduce the rusting process - painting your concrete.

###  3. High Temperatures

High temperatures accelerate the rusting process temperature acts and catalyst that quickens the rust reaction process. Further, the presence of high temperature leads to high disintegration of rust material from the metal surface exposing the metal to more rust reactants. Low temperature inactivates the rusting process. However, in case the metal is exposed to water or moisture, rusting will still occur.

###  4. Acidity

The acid reacts with metal upon contact and exposes metal structure to rusting agents in a given environment. Usually, acid decomposes metal (eats away metal) slowly for the surface inwards. The exposed metal crystals may react with water or other chemicals thus accelerating the rusting action on that particular surface. The acid will cause rusting in almost every metal.

The best way of dealing with the acidic areas is to apply sacrificial protection or using complex alloy metal that has a low affinity for an acid reaction. > See Also: > [Painting on Metal Building](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-paint-a-metal-building/)

##  What are the Best Methods of Preventing Rusting from metal?

###  a. Greasing

Greasing entails the application of grease on the metal surfaces to keep off moisture and other agents of rusting. Grease would be appropriate when used on moving parts (machine parts or automobile). Fiction resulting from moving parts exposes the metal to primary rusting agents if not well grease or maintained frequently with use. You may also use [sandblasting as it is easy and safe](https://www.sciencedirect.

com/topics/chemistry/sandblasting).

###  b. Painting

Coating metal surface with paint is the best way of preventing rust since paint eliminates direct moisture from the metal surface. The paint selected metal coating should be matched with the prevailing environmental condition oil-based paint should be used to coat outdoor metals, while water-based paint should be sued to coated indoor metal structures. Metal should be painted when dry to prevent peeling or scuffing due to moisture content.

###  c. Alloying

Alloying is a process when different metals are molten and mixed to improve metal rust-resistant properties without necessarily painting or greasing. An alloy metal should be used in the rust-prone areas to reduce maintenance costs associated with rust occurrences. Examples of alloys include brass, bronze, etc.

###  d. Galvanizing

Galvanizing is a process when metal is coated with another metallic material that is resistant to rusting when exposed to rust agents. Galvanized metals are more resistant to rust and guarantees a longer service life as compared to painted metal. Usually, the galvanizing process is slightly costly and cumbersome but reliable and best for the metal used in a rainy environment.

Galvanized metal should be avoided in an acidic and saline environment since such a medium may eat up the surface material and trigger the rusting process.

###  e. Sacrificial Protection

In this method, a highly reactive metal is connected to a lowly reactive metal (the main metal to pre protected) in order to prevent rusting action. Usually, the tagged metal preferentially reacts with rust agents, thus protecting the main metal material. I a real situation, an indicator should be connected to sacrificial metal to show when the metal has depleted due to rust reaction.

This method is suitable for metal pipes and containers that are used in wet areas.

##  Precautions and Safety Measures to Consider When Removing Rust from Metal

During the rust removal process, it is recommended that you follow the following precautions and safety measures: 1. Always wear protective gear (boots, overall, respirator, facemask, gloves, and goggles) when removing rust from the metal surface for safety reasons. 2. When using commercial rust remover, follow the manufacturers instructions strictly. 3.

Never blow rust particles with your mouth the metal particles are very poisonous when inhaled. 4.

Follow the right procedure when using a particular last removal method 5. Commercial rust removers should not be inhaled directly they contain chemical components that may irritate your nasal cavity. 6. Avoid using concentrated acid during the rust cleaning process the acid may react with a metal surface instead of cleaning the rust section. 7. In case you get into contact with rust remover, wash the area with soap and water immediately. 8.

All remains of rust removers should be store in a secure place away from pets and kids. > See Also: > Rustoleum galvanized metal primer
