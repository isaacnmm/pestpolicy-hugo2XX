Optoma HD142 XE has better picture quality compared to both BenQ HT2150ST and Viewsonic PJD7828HDL. However, Viewsonic PJD7828HDL would be the best option for rooms with limited sizes. For a dark or dim lighted room, youll find the Optoma HD142 XE amazing but its 1080p resolution still performs poorer than that of BenQ HT2150ST and Viewsonic PJD7828HDL.
- HD142 has a manual zoom to enable easier positioning but will show a narrow range ad lacks the lens shift.
