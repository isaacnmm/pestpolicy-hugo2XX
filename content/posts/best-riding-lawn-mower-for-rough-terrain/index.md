[find a mower](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-choose-a-riding-lawn-mower/)
that is durable and well-built, one which will not loosen up and jam when it comes across little obstacles.
These machines do not come cheap, so finding the one that will last you for a long while also maintaining low costs of operations is critical.
### **1. Easy To Use**
Youll ride this equipment in a rugged landscape so youll need one that is easy to steer, allowing you to avoid, or go over obstacles with ease.
- The steering wheel or navigating gear should be well padded to protect your hand from all the vibrations going on.
- Youll also need one with comfortable seats, which will include full suspension seats or seats with extra padding.
There are those with high seatbacks or mid-back. A high backrest provides more stability and is more comfortable. If you find one with armrest, it will even be better.
### **2. Cutting Deck**
The width of the cutting deck determines how long youll take to mow your lawn. If you have a large yard, then youll need a mower with a broad cutting deck.
- You might also consider one with shorter cutting decks if your lawn is full of obstacles such as trees or large rocks to navigate small spaces between them with ease.
For better usage, use riding lawn mowers that have no less than 38 inches cutting width.
### **3. Transmission**
The type of transmission that youll use will depend on your preference and ability to spend.
A manual transmission will come at a lower price and will last you longer, while an automatic transmission will be costlier but will take a burden off your shoulder when in operation.
- Hydrostatic transmissions are smooth as they do not use belts and, thus, last longer. However, they have a very high price tag.
- A CVT transmission uses two pulleys of different widths, with one connecting to the wheels, and the other to the engine.
With the pulleys working off each other through changing in their diameters, they offer a smooth and steady transition.
No transmission system is perfect. Each comes with advantages and disadvantages. Knowing how your lawn operates to work your way through which transmission will work best for you.
### **4. Warranty**
A warranty is a guarantee that the manufacturer has confidence in his product. When you go for a riding lawn mower, go for a manufacturer that gives a long-term warranty for their product. A few of the above riding lawn mowers come with a minimum of two years' warranty.
Getting a product on warranty will also save you potential costs that you would have incurred without the guarantee. Manufacturers' defects will always happen.
A warranty is there to safeguard you as a consumer, as well as build the reputation of the manufacturer. A manufacturer will not issue a warranty on a riding lawn mower that is faulty, as it will cost them.
## **Conclusion**
Maintenance is the crucial link between you and a well-working riding lawnmower.
- So, sharpen the blades at least twice a year and ensure that you do not use them on wet grass to avoid the grass clamping the edges.
With the best riding lawn mowers at your disposal, youll achieve a beautiful, welcoming lawn in your home, no matter how rugged the terrain is.
