The larger the can the less often you will need to refill the can. Larger capacities of spray canisters tend to be heavier. Overall, it comes down to the personal preferences of the user.

###  5. Spray tip and Motor power

You might want to ensure that the spray tip fits right since you are dealing with latex paint. With the availability of a wide variety in the market, it comes down to personal preferences when choosing the desired spray pattern. You might want to go for a sprayer with a powerful motor if you are looking to achieve improved precision as well as sufficient coverage on larger surfaces for that sought after professional look.
