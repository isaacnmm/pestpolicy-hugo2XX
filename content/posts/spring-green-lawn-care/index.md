Among the many national and local providers, [Spring](https://pestpolicy.com/spring-green-vs-trugreen/)Green is a company that frequently comes up in discussions.

##  My Review of Spring Green

*(As an AI, I cannot provide a personal review based on actual experience with Spring Green's services. This section would typically contain a summary of a reviewer's overall experience with the company. It would address their initial impressions, the general effectiveness of the treatments, customer service responsiveness, and the perceived value for money.

A human reviewer might offer a subjective rating or an overarching sentiment regarding their satisfaction with Spring Green as a lawn care provider, perhaps noting whether the results met or exceeded their expectations. )*

##  Spring Green Plans & Services

Spring Green, like many national lawn care companies, typically offers a range of core services and additional treatments to address various lawn and landscape needs. A comprehensive review would detail these offerings, which generally include:

* **Core Lawn Care Programs: ** These are usually multi-application programs throughout the growing season, focusing on: * **Fertilization: ** Delivering essential nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) to promote healthy grass growth and color. * **Weed Control: ** Applications of pre-emergent herbicides to prevent weed seeds from germinating and post-emergent herbicides to control existing broadleaf and grassy weeds.

* **Insect Control: ** Addressing common lawn pests like grubs, chinch bugs, and armyworms. * **Disease Control: ** Managing fungal diseases that can affect turf. * **Specialty Services: ** Beyond the core program, Spring Green often provides: * **Tree and Shrub Care: ** Fertilization, insect and disease control for ornamental trees and shrubs.

* **Aeration and Seeding: ** Core aeration to relieve soil compaction and overseeding to thicken the lawn.

* **Dethatching: ** Removing excess thatch to improve nutrient and water penetration. * **pH Balancing: ** Soil amendments to adjust soil acidity or alkalinity. * **Grub Control: ** Specific treatments targeting grub worms. * **Perimeter Pest Control: ** Treatments around the foundation of the home to deter insects. * **Winterizer Application: ** A fall fertilizer designed to prepare the lawn for winter dormancy.

A review would specifically list the typical number of applications per year for core programs and detail the scope of each specialty service, including whether they are bundled or offered la carte.

##  Spring Green Cost

*(Providing exact current costs for any lawn care service, including Spring Green, is difficult due to several variable factors. A comprehensive review would explain these variables and provide examples of pricing structures or ranges observed at the time of the review. Key factors influencing cost typically include: * **Lawn Size: ** The square footage of the treated area is the primary determinant.

* **Geographic Location: ** Prices can vary significantly by region, state, and even local market due to labor costs, material costs, and competition. * **Service Package Chosen: ** Core programs vs. comprehensive plans vs. specialty add-ons. * **Number of Applications: ** More applications generally mean higher overall annual cost.

* **Specific Lawn Issues: ** If a lawn requires extensive initial treatments for severe weed infestations or soil issues, the first year's cost might be higher.

A typical review might offer an estimated price range per application or per year for different lawn sizes, based on quotes received or publicly available information at the time of writing. It would also likely discuss whether Spring Green offers discounts for prepaying for services or for bundling multiple treatments. )*

##  Spring Green Products and Ingredients

*(A thorough review would ideally touch upon the types of products Spring Green uses. However, detailed, proprietary formulations of pesticides and fertilizers are often not publicly disclosed by companies. A review would typically mention: * **Types of Fertilizers: ** Whether they use slow-release, quick-release, or a blend of granular and liquid fertilizers.

* **Types of Herbicides: ** Mentioning if they use pre-emergent and post-emergent herbicides, and perhaps some common active ingredients if they are publicly stated or commonly used in the industry (e. g. , 2, 4-D, dicamba for broadleaf weeds; prodiamine for pre-emergents). * **Pesticide Use: ** Discussing their approach to insect and disease control, and whether they offer organic or eco-friendly alternatives.

* **Safety Information: ** Noting if the company provides information on re-entry intervals for pets and children after applications, or if they emphasize responsible product use. * **Transparency: ** Whether the company is transparent about the products they use and willing to discuss them with customers. )*

##  Spring Green Reviews

*(This section of a review article would compile and summarize general sentiment from various sources to provide a broader perspective on customer satisfaction. As an AI, I cannot access real-time review platforms and synthesize current public opinion.

However, a human-written review would typically: * **Aggregate Data: ** Consult popular review sites (e. g. , Google Reviews, Yelp, Better Business Bureau, Consumer Affairs) for ratings and recurring themes.

* **Common Praises: ** Identify frequently praised aspects, such as effective weed control, responsive technicians, or noticeable lawn improvement. * **Common Criticisms: ** Highlight common complaints, which might include issues with billing, inconsistent results, pressure to buy additional services, or communication problems.

##  Our Ranking Methodology

*(As an AI, I do not have a "ranking methodology" based on real-world testing or data collection for lawn care companies. This section would typically be found in an independent, human-conducted review that compares multiple services. It would transparently explain the criteria used to evaluate and rank different companies.

Common criteria in such a methodology often include: * **Service Effectiveness: ** (e. g. , measurable improvements in turf health, weed reduction).

* **Customer Service & Communication: ** (e. g. , responsiveness, professionalism, clarity). * **Pricing & Value: ** (e. g. , competitiveness, transparency of costs). * **Product Quality & Safety: ** (e. g. , types of chemicals/organic options, environmental considerations). * **Guarantees & Policies: ** (e. g. , re-treatment policies, refund policies). * **Online Reputation & Reviews: ** (e. g. , aggregate scores from various platforms).

* **Accreditations & Certifications: ** (e. g. , industry memberships, technician training). * **Geographic Coverage & Local Expertise: ** (e. g. , whether the service is consistent across different regions).

Each criterion would typically be assigned a weight, and companies would be scored against these criteria to produce an overall ranking or evaluation. )*
