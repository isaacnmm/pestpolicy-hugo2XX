Permethrin is one of the synthetic chemicals that are classified under the [pyrethroids family](https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/registration-review-pyrethrins-and-pyrethroids)and come from a chrysanthemum flower. Permethrin has been in use as an insecticide (as approved by EPA) since 1979 but its use has been adopted in 2006. This broad insecticide can be used in a number of techniques in controlling insects. 1.

Controlling mosquitoes, especially in programs meant for the general public. 2. Spraying on clothes, structures, pets, yard or gardens, livestock, ornamental lawns, seed, and food crops. You may also spray around food-handling areas.

##  What's The Permethrin Insect-Killing Power?

Permethrin belongs to the pyrethrins class and so it will affect the insects if they touch it or eat it. - Permethrin will damage the insects nervous system which may lead to death, paralysis, or even muscle spasms. However, permethrin will be less toxic to dogs and humans as compared to how it affects and kills insects. - The reason is that insects are unable to easily break down permethrin compared to how dogs and humans do.

However, permethrin will be more toxic to cats than to humans and dogs - cats will take a longer time to break down the permethrin chemical.

##  How May Humans Get Permethrin Exposure? - Side Effects

Humans may get exposed to permethrin through their eyes, the skin, the breathing system, or even by eating permethrin-containing or contaminated products.

- These results canceled earlier conclusions by the IARC that permethrin was unclassifiable regarding its ability to cause cancer.

##  Permethrin for Lice

Permethrin will work effectively and safely in killing live lice but it won't exterminate those eggs that are unhatched. - I noted that the permethrin treatment was able to kill all the lice that were hatching even a few days after the initial treatment. But experts recommend doing a second permethrin treatment for lice, especially at the 9 to exterminate all the lice that are newly hatched before they lay eggs.

For humans, follow the doctors' lice treatment directions or allow their medication to see it for about 10 minutes. - Next, dry the hair and the scalp using a towel and finally got all the hair tangles you'll find. With an appropriate permethrin-based lice treatment product, you'll be protected from these bugs for about 14 days.
