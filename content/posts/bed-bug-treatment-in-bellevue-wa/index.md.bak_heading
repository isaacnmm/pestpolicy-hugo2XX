- Bed bug infestations are a growing concern for residents and businesses in Bellevue, WA. These persistent pests can cause significant discomfort and anxiety, making prompt and effective treatment essential.
- Bed bugs are notoriously difficult to eliminate due to their small size, rapid reproduction, and ability to hide in tiny crevices.

Our professional bed bug treatment services in Bellevue are designed to thoroughly eradicate these pests and restore peace of mind to your home or business.

####  Identifying Bed Bug Infestations

Bed bugs are small, reddish
- brown insects that feed on human and animal blood. They are often found in mattresses, box springs, bed frames, and upholstered furniture.
- Common signs of a bed bug infestation include small reddish
- brown stains on bedding, tiny dark spots of bed bug excrement, shed skins, and the presence of live bed bugs. Bites on the skin, often appearing as red, itchy welts in a line or cluster, can also indicate an infestation.

If you notice any of these signs, it's crucial to seek professional help immediately.

####  Comprehensive Bed Bug Treatment Services

Our bed bug treatment services in Bellevue are thorough and effective, designed to eliminate all stages of bed bugs from eggs to adults. Our process includes:

- **Chemical Treatments**: In cases where heat treatment is not sufficient, we use approved insecticides that are safe for humans and pets but deadly to bed bugs.

Our technicians apply these treatments to infested areas and potential hiding spots to ensure thorough coverage.
- **Encasements and Monitoring**: We recommend using mattress and box spring encasements to prevent bed bugs from re
- infesting these areas. Additionally, we set up monitoring devices to detect any remaining or returning bed bugs, ensuring that the treatment has been successful.
