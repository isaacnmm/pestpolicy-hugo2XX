##  Best Concrete Driveway Cleaner  Buying Guide

Unlike other types of cleaners, bacterial cleaners leave little or no residue on surfaces. Thus, no brushing or further cleaning is required. The only limitation is that they require repeated use for them to be effective. Also, the cleaning action takes some time compared to the PH cleaners.

Acidic cleaners are used to remove stains that dissolve in acidic solutions. - For example, the efflorescence caused by hard water can be cleaned using acidic cleaners. - Alkaline solutions are ideal for cleaning stubborn stains such as grease and oil. The hydrocarbon chains in these substances are broken down to allow for easy removal with a brush or pressure washing.

Neutral PH cleaners are mostly used where the stain is not embedded on the surface.

###  4. Quantity

The amount of cleaner you need for satisfactory results depends on the type of cleaner, type of stain, and the space you want to clean. - Some cleaners require only a small amount of application while others require large amounts.
