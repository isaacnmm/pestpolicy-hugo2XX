Cimexa CXID032 is an odorless and luckily non-staining bed bug dust (particularly silica-based) that you'll love in your pest control processes. Puff the dust on carpets and mattresses. An interesting fact to note is that silica dust has a higher efficacy in killing bed bugs compared even to diatomaceous earth. Silica will soak the bed bug's wax and thus enhance speedier desiccation.

- Cimexadust is finely ground dust that sticks on a bed bug's body (via electrostatic attraction) and breaks its exoskeleton (cuticle) to dehydrate the bug to its death. Keep off kids and pets. Thesilica dust, which you'll puff onto the [bug's hiding areas, will dry on the bug's exoskeleton](https://pestpolicy.com/what-causes-bed-bugs/)and thus dehydrate it to cause its death.

FenvaStar EcoCap employs "microencapsulation" and will easily give the deadly dose to poison the bed bugs.

But it lacks the quick knock-down effect that's present in other sprays.

To reach the wall cracks and floor crevices, you'll require a pump sprayer. FenvaStar EcoCap is also reusable and cheap, making it an excellent option for most homeowners who need to treat the bugs but on a budget.
