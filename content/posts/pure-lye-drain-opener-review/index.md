Here's a Pure Lye Drain Opener Review - I am here in my basement, and the sink drain has been clogged for a few weeks. Definitely, the sink now has serious stuff such as oils, grease, and debris. I can already smell the bad odor since the water has been standing for a long time. - In this post, Ill be going through tips on using the Pure LyeDrain Openerto unclog slow-moving drains.

- However, the caveat is that this cleaner, despite being among the[top drain cleaners](https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//),is not as effective on a totally clogged drain. However, you can use it tounclog a bathtub that has standing water. **Precautions**: Ensure you wear disposable rubber gloves and safety goggles while ensuring that the rooms are adequately ventilated.

##  **Natural drain cleaner**

The Pure Lye Drain Opener is a pure white formula that is a natural remedy for your clogged drain and sewer full of odor. Pure Lye allows you to do away with the pungent vapors and fumes that come from a clogged drain. Its safe to use either in restaurants, hospitals, educational institutions, and households. I noticed that the finely shaped and small lye beads work great for PVC and metal pipes, chrome trims, and bath fixtures.

The green/ eco-friendly clog remover contains almost 100% biodegradable formula with no bad odors, toxic chemicals, acids, or dyes.

##  Works in all drain types

Pure Lye Drain Opener is powerful enough to unclog quickly(in about 15 30 minutes) all types of septic systems, sewer lines, sinks drains, and shower/ bathtub drains. Also, make sure you pour some hot or warm water down the drain so that you warm (or almost there) the pipes. This will make the lye cleaner function better by quickly activating it.

Youll require to begin with just a few lye tablespoons, and when the water starts going down, you can now add some more over the clogged drain.

Finally, pour some hot or warm water to dissolve the lye and activate it. Now allow the lye to work on the clogged drain for about 15 - 30 minutes. Definitely, some cracking sounds will be coming off the clogged drain as the lye cleaner does its work. Finally, pour additional hot water to clean the slow-moving drain fully.

##  Is lye drain cleaner safe for pipes?

Lye (in chemical terms described as caustic soda/ sodium hydroxide) is considered a reliable drain clog remover. However, some homeowner has understandable fears that it would be too powerful for drain pipes. This is because the chemical is also used on an industrial scale for a cleaning agent or different purposes.

However, to settle this debate, I have to say that this lye [drain cleaner](https://pestpolicy.com/is-drain-cleaner-an-acid-or-base/)could corrode your pipes if you dont use the right concentration (as described in the product label instructions). Therefore, it will be helpful if you use the right concentration to protect your plumbing systems.

###  **Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes**

PVC pipes are made from some form of thermoplastic polymer that is cheap and strong enough to withstand weather changes and some chemicals in your plumbing system. Also, PVC will not react with most chemicals and is light, which implies that the lye clog remover wont corrode its pipes. To get a great glimpse of such reactions, check this [guide on how drain cleaners work](https://pestpolicy.com/how-drain-cleaners-work/).

####  **Corrosive to metal pipes? **

Although PVC pipes can resist corrosion from the lye chemical, weve noted that its important to avoid very high concentrations beyond the recommendation on the product label instructions. Also, lye can corrode some metals due to its caustic nature. You must also not mix the lye drain cleaner with different chemicals like [Drano Max Gel Clog Remover](https://pestpolicy.com/drano-max-gel-clog-remover-review/).

####  **Caustic Lye**

As noted above, lye is a caustic alkali base with its pH being 7. 0 or more. Therefore, despite not being an acid, a strong chemical concentration would still corrode the PVC pipes. Notably, some of the lye cleaners will be mixed with different quantities of aluminum.
