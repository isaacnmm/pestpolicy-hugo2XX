##  Details: Does WD 40 Remove Paint?

*It should also not be applied on surfaces such as naked stones/not sealed, suede, unfinished wood, non-laminated papers, electronics casing, cushioned material, and unpainted walls. * *WD 40 is not suitable for large surface area (due to economic reasons). Notably, the right application of WD 40 leads to excellent paint removal without causing surface destruction or distortion. *

###  a. Active ingredients in WD 40

WD 40 is a hydrocarbon compound whose main ingredients entail petroleum-based paraffin, aliphatic hydrocarbon (which is similar to kerosene), carbon Dioxide, and aliphatic hydrocarbons. These Ingredients are specially formulated (some may be omitted according to the intended use of a particular WD 40 product) and combine chemically for effective action upon application.

Indeed, WD 40 comes with super active agents, which breaks the molecular bonds in the paint (within 3 to 5 minutes), thus forming a thick viscous compound that is easier to strip. Moreover, the solvent features a high penetrative property that works effectively on the dense paint coating.

WD 40 is a less flammable, highly impressive and anti-leak product which integrates hygroscopic characteristic that eliminates the moisture on the surface instantly.

However, the excess application causes humid accumulation from the surrounding, leading to rusting in some surfaces like chain drives. For effective paint removal, WD 40 works best for a small area. See Also: Can You Use Acrylic Paint On Metal?

###  b. Types of paint Removed

WD 40 will clean both latex and water-based paint. The solvent shows the best performance when used on wet paint than a dry one. However, WD 40 cures dry paint perfectly, thus allowing smooth stripping without much hassle. Old paint on surfaces such as car bodies, metal coating, and composites may take longer to quench. Therefore, you should use alternative paint removers/thinner (highlighted in this article).

Oil-based paint shows longer stripping time as compared to water-based paint.

The cure time varies with nature and base-components in which the particular type of paint is manufactured. In this regard, the drop test experiment is vital in establishing the efficiency of WD 40 on a particular surface.

###  c. Application Surfaces/Area of Use

For the paint removal process, you can use WD 40 on surfaces such metal (stainless steel, aluminum, chrome, etc. ), plastic (but not clear polystyrene and polycarbonate), sealed wood, leather fabrics, ceramics, glass, Automotive parts, laminated paper, rubber and painted walls without affecting the quality of the original surface of the material. The named surfaces should be polished or cleaned before application to achieve the best results.

You should use a large amount of WD 40 for effective action, and multiple layer sections should be covered well to avoid unnecessary removal from the surrounding.

###  d. Surfaces Not to Use WD 40

Never use WD 40 on firearms. This product is hygroscopic (attracts water); thus, it will accumulate moisture on the surface leading to rust or explosion. Surfaces like chain drives are not recommended since WD 40 is not a lubricant - it also accelerates the wear and tears on the moving part (not a lubricant).

Further, you should avoid using WD 40 over a large surface area (due to economic reasons) and areas such as non-laminated papers, naked stones/not sealed, suede, unfinished wood, cushioned material, electronics casing, and unpainted WD 40 may stain the surfaces, corrode or ever damage the upper layer during the paint removal process.

A necessary precaution to consider is the drop test experiment that helps in confirmation of paint removal efficiency.

###  e. Advantages and Precautions to consider when using WD 40

WD 40 is popular in the industry since 1954 due to unmatched advantages such as: - Less toxic and quick-acting - Dirt and oil resistant - Hygroscopic and less flammable - Non-corrosive and low odor - Non-abrasive and eliminate rust - Easier to clean and long action effects Besides, WD 40 is known to provide numerous alternative solutions at home, as highlighted further in this article.

During application of WD 40, you should consider some of the following precautions for effective paint removal: 1. All surfaces under paint remover should be cleaned enhance quick penetration 2. Respirators or nose mask should be won to prevent nasal irritation - You should wear hand gloves prevents skin burn/irritation 1. Drop test must be carried out to ascertain the effectiveness of paint removal in a particular surface 2.

The area should be well ventilated petroleum-based WD 40 may cause a fire 3. Immediate cleaning should be carried out to prevent WD 40 from damaging the surface under the application. NB: The amount of WD 40 applied over a given surface is a function of the paint layer this is individually determined when carrying out a drop test.

##  Step to Follow when using WD 40 in Paint Removal

For effective paint removal when using WD 40, you will need to follow the laid procedure chronologically. Besides, you need to have the following items: WD 40 solve, soap detergent, sponge, scraper, a piece of clean cloth, clean water, a basic and paintbrush. 1. Clean the surface you intend to remove paint - use paintbrush 2. Administer drop test to ascertain the quality and efficiency of WD 40 on the surface 3.

Spray the painted surface sufficiently and leave it for 3 to 6 minutes to quench forms a thick viscous fluid 4. Using the scrapper, strip the broken paint and wipe using the paintbrush 5. Soak the sponge in the detergent and clean the surface it helps remove the trace of WD 40 left during paint removal 6. Wet the piece of cloth and wipe the surface to dryness. 7. Repeat this procedure on other surfaces too.

In case WD 40 does not remove the paint entirely on the surface, I recommend that you choose other substitutes discussed in this article. However, it would help if you considered the concentration aspect of WD 40 in relation to the thickness of paint before application. Otherwise, you may end up being frustrated by shoddy results.

##  Alternative Home Uses of WD 40

WD 40 is well known for its use in the automotive industry. Apart from paint removal, there are numerous ways in which you can use WD 40 at home. Some of these uses include:

###  a. Removing Rust
