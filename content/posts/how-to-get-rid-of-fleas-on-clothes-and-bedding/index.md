## Details: How to Get Rid Of Fleas on Clothes and Bedding
### 1. Dawn Dish Soap for Killing fleas
Do fleas die in water? Generally, flea eggs and adult fleas won't kill fleas - just like most insects eggs will survive underwater for days.�Just taking your pet for some swim won't kill fleas effectively.
But cleaning the pet
using dawn dish soap
mixture - the soap helps break the water's surface tension - enabling the tiny fleas to sink and drown. Place a lamp near the water to attract fleas.
- Dawn will kill the bugs within five minutes - and thus you'll be ready to rinse the clothes and bedding. For your pet, you may use a handheld showerhead or a cup of water to rinse the dawn soap.
Further, if you thoroughly wet and lather the pet's fur with dawn soap
andflea comb
, you'll drown most of the files eggs. The soap mixture will destroy the bug's
exoskeletons leading to drowning.
**Wash all clothes & bedding for 10 minutes ( in cold water):�**
- Undertake routine washing and dry clothes and bedding. If there are clothes that can't be washed but can be dried, then you'll need to put them in the dryer and run it on a hot cycle for about 30 minutes - which willkill the fleastoo.

- Flea eggs and adultswill not die easilywhen immersed in water. Fleaswill survive in waterfor about seven days. Further, fleas will only drown in water after 24 hours when submerged as they sit on the water and not break water's surface tension. Fleas have cuticles that are covered with wax, and hence its skin is non-wettable with water.
- **However**: Dish soap drops have surfactants that reduce water's surface tension and hence make the flea sink in water and drown. Therefore, washing the fabric with your detergent for ~ 10 minutes would make adult fleas drown**but not the pre-adult fleas**.
- Flea eggs + larvae in your bedding and clothes will require the use of more rigorous laundry methods: This drives us to tactic #2

### 2.�Max Washing Machine Settings**+ Soap�**
Using a washing machine with water + soap will help remove fleas from your bedding and clothes. The water turbulence and heat plus that laundry detergent helps in exterminating the fleas.
- The fleas in all the life stages are either exterminated during the washing process, or they'll eventually end up in your drainage and sewer.
Also, any of the fleas or other insects that'll remain in the initial stages of the washing will be killed by the machine's or water turbulence and the heat.
All you have to do is wash the clothing.�The challenge is getting the right ingredients/ temperature and transporting the clothing and bedding to the laundry area (without dropping some fleas), either in your home or elsewhere.
**Wash Clothing and bedding in Hot Water:�**
- Depending on the type of fabric: Cotton, Silk, Wool, etc...�Wash the clothes in a washing machine or just hot water in a basin.
- However, including a detergent (the mild-type) to the hot water. Check thesevacuums for fleas.
- Adult fleas are exterminated at temperatures surpassing 35 C (95F) and when it is under 13C (55.4F). Also,Flea larvaewill die in their cocoon at a temperature of over 35 C.
- The mechanical action and the hot water in the washing machine would definitely dislodge the fleas from the clothes and beddings and send them down the drain. The flea adults, eggs, larvae, and pupae would not survive through the laundering & drying process.
### 3. Clean with Bleach Water
You can efficiently end the flea cycle on your bedding and clothes using bleach - you'll exterminate both fleas and also adult fleas. Fleas jump off the get to the dark, moist, and warm places.

Wipe the surfaces upon applying the bleach water - you may through the fabrics into your washer with bleach - as opposed to just using the regular detergent.
Check the bleach bottle instructions to know the amount to use on your bedding and clothes - depending on the load. Also, use bleach that's color-safe to protect all colored fabrics.
- For safety, ensure pets and humans (including kids) won't ingest the bleach as it's harmful.
- Vets recommend keeping kids and pets away from bleach-treated surfaces, bedding, and clothes for a minimum of three hours.
But use bleach only on fabrics that can withstand it, but ensure it is well diluted. Mix water (16 gallons) and chlorine bleach (1 cup) - this will disinfect and kill fleas in clothes.
- For bedding, fabrics, and clothes that won't be bleach-safe, use phenolic disinfectants, pine oil, or different antimicrobial detergents.
- Remember to wash the fabrics and clothes at maximum temperature, wash cycle, and water setting.
