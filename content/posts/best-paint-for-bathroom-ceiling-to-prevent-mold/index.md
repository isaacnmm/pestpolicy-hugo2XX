Did you stop by to read through this content because you are desperately looking for the best paint for the bathroom [ceiling](https://pestpolicy.com/best-paint-finish-for-ceilings/)to prevent mold?

Mold thrives on moist surfaces, especially in places with inadequate ventilation, making your [bathroom](https://pestpolicy.com/a-tour-of-chelseas-hall-bathroom-renovation/)ceiling a fertile breeding area for it.

Unfortunately, you cannot just apply any paint, say the water-based type, and expect to eradicate it because some regular water-based paints provide food for these fungi in the long run.

I have labored to give you a list of paints that will solve the mold problem and turn your bathroom into a place you will want to spend a little more time.
