[Paint](https: //pestpolicy. com/airless-paint-sprayer-tips/) peeling is a common problem that occurs on painted walls, ceiling, pavements, or furniture due to loss of stickiness strength over a while. Usually, peels damage the primary surface and destroy the aesthetic impression of a given surface.

*Well, the question at hand is, how do I [fix](https: //pestpolicy. com/how-to-fix-peeling-paint-on-drywall/) peeling paint on the ceiling? Simple! You need to prepare the surface sufficiently (sanding), prime the polished ceiling, repaint, and let the final finish dry naturally without touching even your bathroom.

* *Also, purchase interior paint and primer that match the paint type you intend to apply on a particular ceiling (whether acrylic or latex paint/primer).

Further, the sanding/polishing should be finely done to improve stickiness and eliminate drains during paint application. *

*Remember to put on protective gear (goggles, dustcoat, respirator, gloves, face mask, and safety boots) since human health is paramount and any form of health hazard should be under control. * See Also: Ceiling Paint vs. Wall Paint.

## # a. Items Required

- Putty knife and filler - [Paint scraper](https: //www. amazon. com/dp/B071XDP685/? tag=p-policy-20)and Wire brush - Fine/rough Grain Sandpapers and Tack cloth - Roller and Dropcloth, tarp, plastic piece, or rag - [Shop vacuum](https: //www. amazon. com/dp/B07MPJRLYH/?

tag=p-policy-20)and Dust collection bag - Paintbrush and Masking tape - Flashlight tool and Paint tray - Ladderand Protective gear - Interior Primer and Interior Paint - Respirator and thinner - Paint sprayer

## # b. Ceiling Preparation - Sanding

This stage is crucial since its geared toward eliminating the peels and chips from the ceiling. Further, the ceiling preparation paves the way for a more comfortable way of prime application.

Follow the steps below: - Put on theprotective gear - goggles, dustcoat, respirator, gloves, face mask, and safety boots - Set the ladder in such a way you can access the ceiling without straining consider a stand-alone type of ladder - Lay tack cloth, plastic sheet, or polyethylene paper on the floor to prevent it from straining during the restoration - Using the paint scraper, remove peels gently from the ceiling you can use a wire brush for solid paint peels - Using the putty knife and a filler, seal the holes, cracks, and opening on the ceiling and leave it to cure for 10 minutes - Sand the ceiling gently with rough grain sandpaper and polish with fine-grain sandpaper to remove paint traces - Blow/wipe of dust from the surface using ashop vacuumor a piece of cloth The ceiling should be left dry - any wetness should be dried out (use a heat gun) before priming begins.

## # c. Priming

The primer prepares the primary ceiling surface by sealing any holes or porous points on the primary material. In doing this, the paints stickiness ability is boosted while unnecessary drains/runs are reduced. You can either use an oil-based primer or water-based primer according to the final paint you intend to paint your ceiling.

Follow the steps below: - Mark the ceiling points with masking tape prevents prime overflow to adjacent surfaces when priming.

- Prepare your primer appropriately according to the manufacturers instructions. - Soak the paintbrush or arollerin the primer sufficiently (dont overload) - Gently apply the primer on the ceiling back and fro a roller is preferable as it leaves a better surface finish. - Repeat the process until the entire ceiling is primed NB: Avoid over excess prime application apply sufficiently to cover primary ceiling material.

Do not use a double primer layer.

## # d. Repainting the Ceiling

The repainting process should be carried out in a well-ventilated room. The paint choice (either oil-based or latex paint) should be matched with the primer used. Otherwise, the wrong combination will lead to peeling action with time.

Follow the steps below: - Prepare the paint according to the manufacturers instructions - Soak the roller or a paintbrush sufficiently in the paint (dont overload) - Gently, apply the paint on the ceiling to and from - Repeat the previous step until the entire ceiling is painted - Use an angled paintbrush to paint ceiling corners or clear drains NB: a ceiling paint sprayer guarantees you a better finish when used for ceiling painting.

## # e. Finish

Upon completion, leave the paint to dry for about one hour (follow manufactures advice). Remove all the masking tape gently rapid removal causes paint chipping or damage finish. Clean the paintbrush, roller, or paint sprayer with thinner or water according to the paint used and store it appropriately. Collect the peel debris in a dust collection bag and dispose of it appropriately.

Using a wet piece of cloth or thinner, wipe up any paint/primer sport that may have stained the floor this is best done when the stain is still wet. Remove all equipment and leave the ceiling to cure naturally without touching. > See Also: > Painting a Ceiling Without Roller Marks

# # What Causes House Ceiling Paint to Peel

Paint peeling doesnt just occur naturally - its attributed to causes ranging from the nature of paint to primary surface preparation. Here are some of the major causes of peeling paint on the ceiling:

## # 1. Low-Quality Paints

Low-quality paint has poor flexibility and weak adhesive properties. Such paint has low poor stickiness ability and doesnt dry properly; thus, they end up peeling after a short period.

## # 2. Moisture

Moisture weakens the paint stickiness ability with primary ceiling material. As the moisture penetrates the paint coating, the layers detach, bulge, and eventually peels off.

## # 3. Exposed to High Temperatures

High temperatures weaken paint adhesive bonds that are in direct contact with ceiling surface material. Continued heating leads to cracking, chipping, and peeling off paint coating/layers.

## # 4. Improper Surface Preparation

Improper surface preparation, like imperfect sanding process (rugged surface), creates room for bubble formation when painting. These bubbles break and lead to the peeling action of the paint layer. Uncleaned dirt polish traces on the ceiling surface weakens the paint stickiness leading to peeling with time.

## # 5. Incorrect paint application method

Using the wrong paint application method leads to low paint cohesion on the ceiling surface. The bubbles may be embedded with the paint layer, which may initiate chipping or peeling action with time. Roller painting leaves unattended corners, which triggers peeling action. > See Also: > Paint Roller to Hide Imperfections

## # 6. Painting Dirty Ceiling Surface

The ceiling should be dirt-free before any painting takes place. The presence of dirt weakens paint stickiness strength, thus leading to peeling action.

## # 7. Ceiling Surface Being in a Dry Environment

When the painted ceiling is exposed to arid conditions, the paint adhesive bonds weaken and start to chip and peel off.

## # 8. Paint that is Incompatible with the Ceiling Primary Surface Material

The primary surface material of the ceiling determines the type of paint to use during application. Some paints are not compatible with the ceiling surface. Upon application, the paint layer chips or peels in a short period. Some ceiling material may have chemicals that react with applied paint, thus weakening the paint stickiness on that particular surface.

## # 9. Too Many Layers of Paint

Too many paint layers form a weak surface stickiness. They add self-weight on the ceiling and end up peeling off. Besides, the layers may stretch the first coating on the ceiling and hence breaks the surface contact.

## # 10. Using Old paint

The old paint has a weak paint cohesive bond and low surface stickiness. The paint sticks gently and ends up chipping or peeling after a short period.

## # 11. Different Kinds of Paints Used

Mixing different types of paints weakens the stickiness ability on the ceiling surface. Applying latex paint over acrylic paint will cause peeling off due to a weak paint adhesive bond on a given surface. > See Also: > Shoes for Painters ed
