## Males And Females
It has been noted that, in most cases,
fleas that live
on cats are predominantly female. The reason for this is that female flea tend to outlive their male counterparts, and therefore, even though there are equal numbers of males and females born, the females survive longer.
## Structure Of The Male And Female Flea
The male flea is the proud owner of the most complex male genitals known within the animal kingdom. The penis itself is supported by rods that allow for east entry into the female flea.
Their bodies feature a shield on the outer portion to protect the reproductive organs, and underneath this can be found a clasper which is used to attach the male to a female.
The female flea has an area used for storing the sperm of the male, but her reproductive organs are nowhere near as detailed or complex as the male.
## How Do The Males And Females Find One Another?
Of course, to mate, the male and female fleas must locate one another, and it is thought that this is done through the release of chemicals or pheromones given off by the females.
The male is then able to use his antenna to detect these chemicals and locate the female. Once a male has located his chosen female, he will approach her with a vertical antenna, which signals that he wishes to mate.
The pair will connect initially at the head and then on the lower portion of the body. The male will use his antenna and legs to restrain the female during the mating process and will often remain like this until the entire ritual is over.
One of the most interesting points about the mating of fleas is that during the process, the female will continue to feed unless she is not interested, in which case she may kick the male and walk away.
