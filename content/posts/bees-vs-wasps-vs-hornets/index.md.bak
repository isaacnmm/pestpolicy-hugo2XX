##  Bees vs. Wasps vs. Hornets - 7 Key Differences?

Well, wasps (non-furry insects) are carnivores, while bees are furry and will east flower pollen to produce honey. Check these sprays for yellow jackets.

###  **1. ****Color**

**Bee: ** The color of bees can range between yellow and black, depending on the species. But [honey bees share different traits](https://askabiologist.asu.edu/honey-bee-anatomy)with various bugs. For instance, honey bees have a golden-yellow color with a characteristic brown band. Bumblebees are tan in color with yellow or orange coloration. Bees have 3 pairs of legs - and thus may be considered like [insects](http://www.reachoutmichigan.

org/funexperiments/agesubject/lessons/insect.html).

**Wasp: ** Wasps come in a myriad of colors. There are over [30, 000 different wasps](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/invertebrates/group/wasps/).Stinging wasps have bright colors that serve as a warning to intruders. For example, the yellow and black color on yellow jackets indicates they have the ability to sting. **Hornet: ** Usually, hornets will appear to be black and white.

However, the European hornet is brown with either orange or yellow markings.

The yellow hornet is yellow and black in color.

###  **2. ****Body Appearance**

**Bee: ** Bees have three body parts, just like other insects Head, thorax, and abdomen. The part connecting the abdomen and thorax is thicker in bees than in both wasps and hornets. Bees come in different sizes depending on the species. Bumblebees are wider and hairy, while honeybees are small in girth and less hairy.

**Wasp: ** A wasps body is segmented into three parts with a characteristic thin waistline, distinguishing them from either bees or hornets.

They have a slim body, which is less hairy compared to bees. **Hornet: ** Hornets are close relatives of wasps, although they emerge from different species. They have a larger body and a thicker waist when compared to wasps. [Hornets look very similar to wasps](https://www.gov.mb.ca/housing/pubs/pests/bees.pdf)- notice their elongated and thin body.

###  **3. ****Nesting Habits**

**Bee: ** Although all bees live in colonies, their nesting habits vary from one species to another. Honeybees make their nests in voids found on walls or tree hollows. A typical honeybee colony can hold up to 10, 000 bees. On the other hand, bumblebees live in underground burrows, especially those abandoned by burrowing animals. They live in colonies of hundreds of bees.

**Wasp: ** Wasps build nests using a paper-like substance, which they give out after chewing wood fiber.

These nests appear as open-end hexagonal cells similar to honeycombs. Wasp nests can be found under sheltered building eaves, tree branches, open pipes, and in places like garage and attics. The location of nests depends on the wasp species. While mud daubers prefer building nests in higher areas, [yellow jackets](http://naturemappingfoundation.org/natmap/facts/yellow_jacket_712.html)will build nests on the ground.

Wasp nest can be as small as a golf ball and grow to as large as football or even bigger. Enormous nests of up to 15000 wasps have been found in Alabama. **Hornet: ** [Hornet removal](https://pestpolicy.com/hornet-nest-removal/)appear as paper-like substances with a grayish color. However, unlike the bee and wasp nests, they are oval-shaped.

They construct their nests overhanging from higher places like trees, chimneys, outside buildings, poles, etc.

A hornet nest starts as a small piece but can grow to the size of a basketball. Related: Effective Homemade Fruit Fly Trap (s)

###  **4. ****Diet and Feeding**

**Bee: ** A bees diet mainly entails pollen and nectar. Since they crave sweet food, they also feed on sweet juices such as those found in fruits and soft drinks. Thats why you might see bees hovering around during your outdoor parties or treats. The worker bees do the work of collecting nectar and pollen and bringing it to the nests for the rest of the colony.

**Wasp: ** Wasps forage for their food among invertebrates such as flies, spiders, ants, caterpillars, and other small insects.

Some are omnivorous and will feed on honeydew, nectar, and fallen fruits. **Hornet: ** Hornets are omnivorous they feed on sugary plant foods such as tree sap and rotting fruits. Theyre also predators of small insects such as flies, among others.

###  **5. ****Aggressiveness**

**Bee: ** Bees are less aggressive than both wasps and hornets - but [can sting](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bee-stings/symptoms-causes/syc-20353869).Bees will not sting you unless they feel threatened or when defending their nests. But unlike wasps and hornets, they have barbed stingers which bite only once. **Wasp: ** Wasps are more aggressive than bees but not as aggressive as hornets.

Like others in the Vespidae family, they can sting several times, each time withdrawing their stinger from the victim. [Wasps may also sting](https://www.healthline.com/health/wasp-sting)-they usually sting when provoked or defending their nests. **Hornet: ** Hornets are very quick at stinging. They will sting at the slightest provocation. They belong to the Vespidae family, whose stingers are not barbed.

That means they can sting several times because of the ability to withdraw their stinger.

A hornet sting inflicts a lot of pain and can sometimes lead to fatal allergic reactions in some individuals.

###  **6. ****Nest Behavior**

**Bee: ** A bee nest consists of the queen, female workers, and the male drones. The queen lays eggs while the drones do the work of mating with the queen. Female workers are responsible for housekeeping, gathering food, protection, and feeding larvae. **Wasp: ** Most of the wasp species live a solitary life. In this case, mature females dig or construct nests near food sources to live and lay eggs.

A few species exhibit a social behavior where they live as a community.

These include yellow jackets and paper wasps. A colony of social wasps mainly entails the queen and the female workers. Males leave the hive immediately after mating and die due to dehydration. Mating occurs in summer, where the females hibernate only to start new colonies in spring. New males for the next mating season emerge from the unfertilized eggs.

Female workers are tasked with all communal work, including gathering food, housekeeping, feeding the larvae, and protecting the colony.

**Hornet: ** At the center of a hornet hive is the queen, whose sole function is to lay eggs for reproduction. The seemingly few males in the nest only do mating and will die soon after mating. Female hornets perform daily communal jobs such as getting food, building the nest, protection, and feeding the larvae.
