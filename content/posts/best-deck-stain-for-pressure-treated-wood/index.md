## Top 7 Best [Deck](https://pestpolicy.com/best-deck-sealer-for-pressure-treated-wood/)Stain for Pressure Treated Wood in 2025

###  [1. THOMPSONS WATER-SEAL Stain (Water-proofing & Transparent)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IKVLXYI/?tag=p-policy-20)

Thompsons water-seal is a clear (transparent) deck stain that will leave your pressure-treated wood showing its fresh look and try colors. Equally, this stain will protect the wood against graying or darkening and UV rays' harsh effects.

How long does Thompson's Water Seal last? Well, the Thompsons water-seal stain will last for about ten years as it's protected from sunlight (UV rays) and moisture (including water). Experts recommend a single stain coat every 1-3 years considering sun exposure and deck use - you may use a paint pad, paint roller, or a garden sprayer. So, is this Thompson Water-Seal a water or oil-based stain?

Well, it's undoubtedly an oil-based stain that'll also seal the wood against water infiltration in addition to getting into and blocking off the wood pores. The oil-based stain is preferred because it'll "repel" the water that'll land on the wood surface. But what'll happen when it rains immediately after applying the Thompson's Water Seal? Sadly, the rainwater will damage the coating of the stain having mineral oil and linseed oil.

The stain coat requires a few hours to dry, and hence within that time, the stain will be damaged by the rain. Cleaning up for Thompson Water-Seal application requires using just water and soap. Also, remember to follow the manufacturer's stain usage instructions. Luckily, this strain combines with waterproofing and staining capabilities for the best results on your pressure-treated wood.
