Wasps are a common sight in Vancouver during the warmer months. While they play a beneficial role in controlling other pest populations, they can become a serious nuisance and pose risks to human health.

Wasps are known for their aggressive behavior, especially when they feel threatened or when their nest is disturbed. Stings from wasps can be painful and, in some cases, cause severe allergic reactions that require medical attention.
#### Identifying [Wasp](https://pestpolicy.com/baby-wasp/) Infestations
Detecting a wasp infestation early is crucial in preventing it from becoming a significant problem. Signs of wasp activity include:
- **Increased Wasp Sightings**: Frequent sightings of wasps around your property, particularly near food sources, garbage cans, and outdoor dining areas.
- **Nests**: Wasps build nests from chewed wood fibers mixed with their saliva, creating a papery structure. Nests can be found in various locations, such as under eaves, in attics, trees, shrubs, and even underground.
- **Buzzing Sounds**: A constant buzzing sound near certain areas of your property can indicate the presence of a wasp nest.
