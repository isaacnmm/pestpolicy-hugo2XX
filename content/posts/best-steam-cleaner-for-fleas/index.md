When choosing the
**best steam cleaner for [fleas](https://pestpolicy.com/best-cordless-vacuum-for-pet-hair/)**
, you need to consider factors like heat output, tank size, pressure, and versatility.
- Fleas are resilient pests, and a good steam cleaner will help eliminate them at every stage of their lifecyclefrom adult fleas to their eggs and larvae.
Below, well break down the most important factors to consider when choosing a steam cleaner and provide recommendations to help you make an informed buying decision.
## Key Factors to Consider
### 1. Temperature and Heat Output
The effectiveness of a steam cleaner in eliminating fleas is closely tied to its temperature.
**High heat**
is crucial because fleas, especially their eggs and larvae, are resistant to lower temperatures. A steam cleaner that produces steam at over 200F is ideal.

For instance, the
**Dupray Neat Steam Cleaner**
generates steam up to 275F, ensuring it not only kills adult fleas but also penetrates and destroys flea eggs, preventing reinfestation. Lower-temperature steamers may not have the same effect on eggs, which could lead to recurring flea issues.
### 2. Versatility and Attachments
The ability to clean various surfaces is another critical factor. Fleas can hide in carpets, upholstery, and even hard floors, so a steam cleaner with multiple attachments is a must. The more versatile the machine, the better it will be at reaching every nook and cranny in your home.

The
[**McCulloch-MC1275 Flea Steamer**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000DF0RB/?tag=p-policy-20)
stands out in this area with its 18 attachments, including scrub pads, brass brushes, and a floor mop attachment. This makes it perfect for deep-cleaning carpets and furniture where fleas often nest.
### 3. Tank Capacity and Continuous Use
When dealing with fleas, especially in larger areas, tank capacity becomes a key factor. A larger tank means longer cleaning sessions without the need for frequent refills. This allows for a more efficient cleaning process and better results in eradicating fleas.

For example, the
**Dupray Neat Steam Cleaner**
boasts a large 54-ounce water tank, providing up to 50 minutes of continuous cleaning. On the other hand, the
**PurSteam Handheld Pressurized Steam Cleaner**
has a smaller tank of 8 ounces, which limits continuous use but is great for quick, targeted cleaning tasks.
### 4. Steam Pressure
High-pressure steam helps to deeply penetrate into carpets, rugs, and upholsteryareas where fleas like to hide. Its important to choose a steam cleaner that offers strong steam pressure to dislodge fleas and their eggs from deep within fabric fibers.

The
**Wagner Spraytech 0282014 HomeRight SteamMachine Elite**
offers strong steam pressure that ensures deep penetration, making it effective for heavily infested areas. This model is particularly useful for reaching hidden areas where fleas could be thriving.
### 5. Portability and Ease of Use
If you plan to steam clean multiple rooms or areas of your home, portability becomes a key consideration. Some steam cleaners are heavy and bulky, while others are designed to be lightweight and easy to maneuver. The portability of a steam cleaner impacts how easily you can clean areas like stairs, upholstery, or even vehicles.

The
**PurSteam Handheld Pressurized Steam Cleaner**
is lightweight and portable, making it ideal for quick jobs or smaller areas. For larger spaces, a more powerful but still maneuverable option like the
**Bissell PowerFresh Lift-Off Pet Steam Mop**
may be a better choice.
