Silverfish are small, wingless insects known for their silvery-grey appearance and fish-like movements. Though generally harmless, these pests can become a nuisance due to their tendency to damage books, wallpaper, and clothing, while feeding on starches and sugars.

If you've noticed silverfish lurking in your home, it's essential to address the issue promptly. In this blog, we'll explore how to identify silverfish, what attracts them, and effective methods to eliminate them.

###  1. Why Are Silverfish Attracted to Your Home?

To effectively get [rid](https://pestpolicy.com/getting-rid-of-fleas-in-the-carpet/)of silverfish, it's essential to understand why they invade homes in the first place. These insects thrive in environments where they have easy access to food, moisture, and shelter.

Heres what typically attracts silverfish: - **High Humidity: **Silverfish thrive in areas where humidity levels are above 75%. Bathrooms, kitchens, and basements are perfect habitats due to the moisture in these areas. - **Dark Spaces: **Silverfish are nocturnal, preferring dark and damp spaces to hide during the day. - **Starchy Materials: **Silverfish feed on starchy substances such as paper, glue, fabric, and even dead skin cells.

Common items they chew on include books, wallpaper, cardboard, and even old photographs. The best way to prevent silverfish infestations is by making your home less hospitable to them.

###  2. Preventative Measures

Silverfish infestations can be frustrating, but taking steps to make your home less appealing to them will help reduce their presence. Here are some simple measures to prevent an infestation:

####  a.**Control Humidity Levels**

As mentioned earlier, silverfish thrive in humid environments. You can lower your homes humidity by: - Using a**dehumidifier**in damp areas such as basements and bathrooms. - Ensuring proper ventilation in rooms prone to moisture build-up, like kitchens and bathrooms. - Fixing**leaky pipes**or faucets to prevent excess moisture accumulation. - Installing**exhaust fans**in the bathroom or kitchen.

####  b.**Seal Cracks and Crevices**

Silverfish can easily enter your home through tiny cracks and crevices. Inspect the exterior of your house for any gaps around doors, windows, or vents and seal them using caulk or weather stripping.

####  c.**Declutter and Organize**

Silverfish often nest in cluttered, dark areas. By reducing clutter and organizing your home, especially in basements and attics, youll minimize their hiding spots. Store important items like books and clothing in airtight containers to prevent damage.

####  d.**Regular Cleaning**

Frequent vacuuming and dusting can help remove silverfish food sources like dead skin cells, hair, and starchy materials. Dont forget to clean under furniture, in closets, and other hard-to-reach places where silverfish may hide.

###  3. Natural Remedies

For those who prefer non-chemical solutions, several natural remedies can help eliminate silverfish. These methods are eco-friendly, safe for pets and children, and effective when used consistently.

####  a.**Diatomaceous Earth**

Diatomaceous earth (DE) is a natural powder made from fossilized remains of tiny aquatic organisms. The fine particles in DE are sharp enough to cut through the exoskeleton of silverfish, leading to dehydration and death. Sprinkle food-grade DE around areas where youve seen silverfish, such as baseboards, cupboards, and under sinks.

####  b.**Essential Oils**

Certain essential oils, like lavender, cinnamon, and clove oil, can help repel silverfish due to their strong scent. Mix a few drops of these oils with water and spray the solution around the house, particularly in areas where silverfish have been spotted.

####  c.**Cedar Shavings**

Silverfish dislike the scent of cedar. You can place cedar shavings in closets, bookshelves, and other storage areas to deter them. Replace the shavings every few months to maintain their effectiveness.

####  d.**Homemade Silverfish Traps**

You can create [simple traps](https://pestpolicy.com/best-silverfish-traps/)using materials you likely already have. Roll up a damp newspaper and leave it overnight where silverfish are active. By morning, the insects will have crawled inside seeking moisture. Dispose of the newspaper (and the silverfish) outside or in the trash.

###  4. Chemical Solutions

If natural remedies dont yield the desired results, you may need to use chemical treatments to eliminate silverfish. Be cautious when using chemicals, especially if you have pets or children at home.

####  a.**Insecticidal Sprays**

There are various insecticidal sprays on the market designed specifically to kill silverfish. Look for products containing pyrethrin or permethrin, and apply them to the baseboards, around windows, and in other places where silverfish are likely to hide.

####  b.**Boric Acid**

Boric acid is a popular choice for eliminating pests, including silverfish. It works by poisoning the insect when they ingest it. Sprinkle boric acid powder in areas where silverfish are active, but be cautious as it can be toxic to pets if ingested.

####  c.**Silverfish Bait**

Similar to cockroach bait, silverfish bait contains a slow-acting poison that attracts the pests. Once consumed, the silverfish will return to their nest and spread the poison to other members of the colony.

###  5. When to Call a Professional

In most cases, silverfish infestations can be managed with the above methods. However, if the infestation is severe, widespread, or recurring, it might be time to consult a pest control professional.

A professional exterminator can: - Identify the severity of the infestation - Pinpoint exact hiding spots - Use stronger treatments not available to the public - Offer long-term prevention advice Hiring a professional ensures that the problem is fully eradicated and reduces the likelihood of future infestations.

###  Conclusion

Silverfish are persistent pests, but with a combination of natural remedies, chemical treatments, and preventative measures, you can effectively get rid of them.

Start by reducing the moisture in your home, decluttering spaces where they hide, and sealing any potential entry points. If silverfish persist, try a combination of traps, [repellents](https://pestpolicy.com/best-silverfish-repellent/),or even professional help.

By taking these steps, youll safeguard your home from silverfish and prevent the damage they can cause to your belongings.
