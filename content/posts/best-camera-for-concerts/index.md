[Live concerts](https://en.wikipedia. org/wiki/Concert) have diverse lighting conditions with fast-paced events & excessive flickering or lighting. Thus, you'll require a camera that is very portable, and that offers high power in addition to ISO sensitivity.

Summary: To take exceptional pictures or shoot great videos in concerts, use either [Canon EOS 6D DSLR](https://www.amazon. com/dp/B009B0MZ8U/? tag=p-policy-20) or [Nikon D5300 24. 2 DSLR](https://www.amazon. com/dp/B00I1CPA0O/? tag=p-policy-20) as the best camera for concerts.

##  Considerations in Best Camera for Concerts

###  [1. Point and shoot cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-and-shoot_camera)

Pocket size cameras (digital camera kind) such as Canon IXUS 185 or Sony Cyber-shot WX220 taking decent photos and video (some even 4K). They are small and offer great portability. But, they wont match the quality offered by mirror-less camera or DSLRs. Check these Point and Shoot Camera Under 100.

###  [2. Mirrorless cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirrorless_interchangeable-lens_camera)

Mirrorless cameras (compact system cameras (CSCs)), unlike the DSLRs, come with no mirror (but have and interchangeable lenses). But, you'll need a higher budget compared to DSLRs. They have faster processing and superior autofocus with the electronic optical viewfinders - with a compact & sleek design.

###  [3. DSLR (Digital Single-Lens Reflex) Cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_single-lens_reflex_camera)

DSLR (such as Canon EOS Rebel T7i/800D or Nikon D5600) blend the digital imaging sensor and single-lens reflex devices (with reflex design scheme) & optics. Check the [Camera for YouTube](https://pestpolicy.com/best-camera-for-youtube/). But, DSLRs have a large build design therefore wont serve if you need super portability and sleeker design. DSLR is praised for being inter-changeable - can switch in & out of lenses.
