While its often associated with schoolyards, tetherball can be enjoyed in backyards, parks, or anywhereyou can set up the equipment.

###  Equipment Youll Need

Before you start playing, lets go over the basic setup:
- **Tetherball Pole**: A sturdy, vertical pole, typically 10 feet tall, anchored into the ground or a weighted base.
- **Tetherball**: A ball (similar to a volleyball) attached to the pole with a rope, usually 6
- 7 feet long.
- **Court**: A circular playing area, about 20 feet in diameter, with a dividing line splitting it into two equal halves.

You can purchase a tetherball set from a sporting goods store or improvise with a DIY setup.

Just ensure the pole is secure and the rope is strong enough to withstand vigorous play.

###  Setting Up the Game
- **Install the Pole**: If youre using a portable set, secure the base with sand or water as instructed. For permanent setups, the pole should be cemented into the ground.
- **Attach the Ball**: Tie the rope to the top of the pole so the ball hangs about 2
- 3 feet above the ground when at rest.
- **Mark the Court**: Draw or imagine a circle around the pole and a line through the center to divide the space into two sidesone for each player.

###  Basic Rules of Tetherball

Tetherball rules are straightforward, but they can vary slightly depending on where you play. Heres a standard set to get you started:
- **Objective**: One player tries to wrap the rope around the pole clockwise, while the other aims for counterclockwise. The first to fully wrap the rope in their direction wins.
- **Starting the Game**: Decide who serves first (flip a coin or play rock
- paper
- scissors).

The server hits the ball in their chosen direction to begin.
- **Gameplay**: Players hit the ball back and forth, staying within their half of the court. You can use your hands, fists, or forearms to strike the ball.
- **Winning**: The game ends when the rope is fully wrapped around the pole, and the ball can no longer be hit.

###  Common Fouls and Penalties

To keep the game fair, watch out for these infractions:
- **Crossing the Line**: Stepping into your opponents half is a foul. Penalty: The other player gets a free hit.
- **Rope Touching**: Grabbing or holding the rope is not allowed. Penalty: Loss of the point or a free hit for the opponent.
- **Double Hit**: Hitting the ball twice in a row (without it passing to the other side) is a foul. Penalty: The opponent gets a free hit.
