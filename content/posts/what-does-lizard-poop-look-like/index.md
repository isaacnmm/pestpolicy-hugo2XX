## # **Where Do Lizards Poop?**

According to a [research](https: //www. sciencemag. org/news/2019/08/lizards-poop-biggest-rocks-around) done at the university of Antwerp, lizards exhibit some similarity in their choice of toilet. In the controlled experiment, 90 lizards were each placed in an enclosure with different sizes of rocks. Surprisingly, 80% of the lizards pooped on the largest rock.

It has been previously indicated that wall lizards communicate with their fecal droppings.

Male lizards mark their territories with feces so that other males can keep off. So, defecating on the biggest rock suggested an attempt to make their signals as conspicuous as possible. Another explanation for this is that lizards spend most of their time on large rocks, to have a good view of possible predators. The research doesnt however conclude on the possible motivation for the observed behavior.

But it suggests that lizards leave their poop in conspicuous areas as a sign of communication.

*Lizard Poop: * The diet of lizards is composed of small insects and arachnid. A few species include plants in their diet. They excrete small pellet-like feces the size of rodent feces. The size of the droppings depend on the species and size of the lizard. The droppings have a small white portion which is fairly dry compared to those of snake poop. *Snake poop: * Unlike lizard poop, snake poop is quite lose and has no defined shape.

The white portion on the end of the poop is more liquid and relatively larger than that in lizard poop. A snake feeds by swallowing their prey whole.
