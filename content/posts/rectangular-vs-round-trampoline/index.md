##  Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline- Details

When deciding which trampoline shape you want for your family, its important that you consider the size of your backyard, the ideal trampoline location in the backyard, number of children that would play on the trampoline, and your budget.

Both round and rectangular trampolines are good options worth considering. However, depending on your specific circumstances one might serve you better than the other might.

Therefore, in the next section I will provide all the differences and similarities between the two options. Thus, help you decide which between the two suits you best.

##  Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline  Differences

###  Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline Weight Limitation

When buying a trampoline, its important that you check its weight limitation. You would want to consider the number of children that would use it. Also, remember that adults might join the little ones during the jumps.

If both adults and children will use the trampoline, a rectangular one will be the best choice. Nonetheless, a small family can buy the round trampoline.

**Heres A Rough Weight Limit Estimate For Round Trampolines** - The weight limit for a 14 to 16-foot round trampoline is about 250400 pounds - A 12FT round trampoline has an approximate weight limit of between 250300 pounds - A 8FT to 10FT round trampoline can hold about 200250 pounds **Rectangular Trampoline- Weight Limitation ** - All rectangular trampolines will hold about 300FT-450FT pounds.

###  Rectangular Vs. Round Trampoline Safety

The rectangular trampoline has a large jumping area that allows you to choose where you want to land. Thus, Landing at the edges might cause injuries with the springs. On the other hand, in a round trampoline the user will only land at the center of the mat. Thus, chances of injuries reduce.

Youll experience a higher bounce in a rectangular trampoline. Hence, if youre a gymnasts or an athlete the rectangular trampoline would be a great choice. It will allow you perform your flips, twirls, and all the tricks you need to practice safely.

Nevertheless, rectangular trampolines might not be the safest for young children. This option encourages higher jumps and dangerous turns that can cause injuries to the little ones. Nonetheless, with adult supervision, a rectangular trampoline would be a great choice.

However, the round trampoline will not give you a higher bounce compared to the rectangular option. The design of the round trampoline doesnt support a higher jump at the edges like in the rectangular option. Thus, all the jumping takes place at the center in the round trampoline.

The low jumping height and the center jump makes round trampoline a safer option for children. Without getting to the edges, children cant come across springs that might hurt them. The low height jump will not allow dangerous maneuvers.
