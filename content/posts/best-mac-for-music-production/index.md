I tested this MacBook Pro's low-latency performance using Ableton Live in Pro Tools and stand-alone with excellent results. It has pro ports - (4) 40Gb Thunderbolt 3 that also act as USBC connections. Despite that, the 16-inch screen can't compare to the 27-inch in iMac Pro, MacBook Pro is significantly better than most Macs when it comes to less software clustering for music production.

###  [2. Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch Space Gray](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K234RCV/?tag=p-policy-20)

Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch is similar (with Touch Bar to improve music making productivity ) to Apple 15 MacBook Pro but with a smaller sized display and some trade-offs in features. T he machine has an Intel Core i5 (2. 4GHz) style quad-core processor. Further, the SSD (Solid-state drive) type of storage you can easily (and quickly) navigate various music or audio files.

New features include the True Tone display, Hey Siri, and an improved Magic keyboard - just like in MacBook Air with the physical Escape key and essential travel being 1mm. **Sneak Peek: ** - Processor: 8th-Gen (quad-core) Core i5 - Storage: 256GB SSD - Memory: 8GB RAM - Screen size: 13-Inch (Brilliant Retina) - *Design*: 14. 9mm thick - *Ports*: 4 Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) - *Headphone Jack*: 3. 5 mm

But with the highly portable 13-inch MacBook Pro (thin and light), I can now work at coffee shops, trains, or planes. This Mac has analog modeled plugins and fabulous mixing headphones to allow fast editing tune vocals and drums while traveling. The MacBook Pro has a silicone layer below every key, and thus you won't experience stuck keys. With its 2560 * 1600 pixels' True Tone display is colorful, bright, and sharp in resolution.

It has Intel Iris 655 Plus graphics, which are awesomely helpful for video and photo editing.

###  [3. iMac Pro 27-inch - Best Studio Mac for Audio Production](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07895T7BW/?tag=p-policy-20)

iMac Pro 27-inch is great for large video or audio editing projects, including 4K & 8K plus for VR simulations and 3D rendering. You'll get a powerful iMac to record and produce with most DAWs. For your home studio, I recommend this iMac Pro 27-inch as it has many USB and USB-C ports plus adequate power to run your Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software easily.

**Sneak Peek: ** - *Processor*: 8-Core Xeon w - *Storage*: 1TB storage (SSD) - *Memory*: 32GB RAM upgradable to 64GB / 128GB - *Screen size*: 27-inch display(diagonal) + itsRetina 5K - *Design*: 5-mm-thin - *Ports*: 4USB 3, 4 Four Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C), - *Headphone Jack*: 3. 5 mm, four mics, Stereo speakers The Radeon Pro Vega 56 graphics (with 8GB HBM2 memory) are great for music and video editing.

The 5-mm thin screen and built-in CPU won't take much space and will display vast information compared to the 21. 5-inch model. You'll get an SDXC slot and the headphone mini-jack that'll allow the production of fantastic sound from your internal stereo speakers. In addition to the Mac Pro features, this iMac Pro has a 5K retina that's simple to set up. After giving an update to the Logic Pro X, this iMac Pro is even better for production.

Logic Pro X now supports eighteen processor cores (named 36 threads). It can now run many plugins plus tracks and sample libraries.

###  [4. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch Retina display - Latest Model)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K1WRY8H/?tag=p-policy-20)

The MacBook Pro vs. MacBook Air for Music Production debate came up lately on an [apple discussion](https://discussions.apple. com/thread/5855044). It has Thunderbolt 3 ports, a Retina display, a new trackpad and keyboard, and a modern Intel processor. Apple has maintained the 12 hours battery life, which is great for music production while traveling.

- Compared to the old MacBook Air, this laptop has achieved a 30% upgrade on its Graphics performance.

- It has a 128GB SSD storage to take 1 GB/sec and 2 GB/sec in write and read speeds, respectively. This is blazing fast for a laptop its size. MacBook Air Retina display comes with a 2560x1600 resolution (with DCI-P3 color gamut). This is four times better compared to the older MacBook Air. It has black bezels, lighter (2. 75 pounds), and thinner just about the size of the MacBook Pro.

It has Touch ID, which provides the real ESC key and Function keys.

The T2 processor allows audio processing, disk encryption, secure booting. MacBook Air has a new butterfly-switch keyboard with a silicone membrane for a quieter typing experience. This is because MacBook Air has low travel and prevents dust. Further, it has louder speakers with bass response. It also comes with the modern Force Touch trackpad that is easy to click and is more substantial.

Apple has done away with the MagSafe connector, SD card reader, USB-A ports.

Instead, MacBook Air adopted USB-C charging and has two Thunderbolt 3 connectors (40 Gbps). Due to a lack of USB-A connectors, you'll need to purchase a dongle.

###  [5. Apple MacBook Pro Retina 2015 Core i7 2.2GHz](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07J3WBHTS/?tag=p-policy-20)

Macs are still a favorite with music-makers & DJs. Apple 15" MacBook Pro Retina is robust, has many USB ports, *MagSafe present, and no noisy butterfly keys. * Further, It's compatible with many DAWs that are optimized to work with the Mac OS. Therefore, there are fewer performance issues or crashes. B *ut, why didn't I include the MacBook Pro 2016?

* Well, MacBook Pro 2016 has a decorative touchpad - whose application is not fully utilized for music production.

But get some hard-drives for great studio work. Also, the 2016 model lacks the MagSafe connector, Firewire sockets, and USB ports. MacBook Pro 2016's Touch-Pad may allow faster access to the tempo, record, stop and play controls on the Ableton Live. Apple 15" MacBook Pro will comfortably run sessions with many plugins and tracks running actively. This is because it has superior 16GB RAM and processing power (quad-core Intel Core i7).

But this Mac has some noise fans that could disrupt your recordings if you're doing this in the same space. SSD storage ( 256GB ) for large-sized files: Also, Apple 15" MacBook Pro uses SSD storage ( 256GB ), and thus you can easily store the large-sized files without slowing the machine. The base model has 8GB RAM and a 3. 6 GHz processor (dual-core) that's making. Here's how different music producers use their Macs.

(1) Traditional production - Record music tracks via mics & instruments and finally mix. (2) DJs and performing musicians will use their Mac in recording and producing tracks and yet in playing. (3) Lastly, hip-hop artists and EDMs use DAW with [Best Laptops For FL Studio](https://pestpolicy.com/best-laptops-for-fl-studio/), MIDI-keyboard controllers, & sequencers.

##  Conclusion

If you're a traveling producer, get a sleek, light, and compact Mac. MacBook Pro 13-inch is excellent for on-the-go music production (when you're traveling). On storage, you'll require a Mac with enough internal disk space for your current projects. But you'll need to transfer other files to an external SSD storage - about 500 GB.

Also, ensure that the room's surfaces and shape are appropriate so that they won't negatively affect the sound's EQ during the recording sessions.

I recommend the iMac Pro 27-inch as the Best Mac for Music Production.
