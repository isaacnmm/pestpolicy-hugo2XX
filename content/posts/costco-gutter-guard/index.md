## Our Take on Costco Gutter Guards
Costco gutter guards, primarily the "EasyOn Gutter Guard" brand, represent a strong value proposition in the DIY gutter protection market. They are designed for homeowners who want to reduce or eliminate gutter cleaning without the significant investment required for professional installation.
The core strength of Costco's offering lies in its **affordability and the accessibility of a micro-mesh product** for self-installation. While they require homeowner effort and don't come with the same "no-clog" guarantees or labor warranties as premium professionally installed systems, they offer a durable stainless steel micro-mesh that is highly effective against a wide range of debris, including fine particles.
For those with a ladder and a bit of DIY know-how, they provide a significant upgrade over cheaper plastic screens and a cost-effective alternative to high-end solutions.

## How Does Costco Gutter Guard Installation Work?
The installation of Costco's EasyOn Gutter Guards is designed to be a DIY process, suitable for homeowners with basic tools and comfort working on a ladder. The product typically comes with two primary installation methods:
1. **Adhesive Tape Method:** Each section of the gutter guard comes with a pre-installed, super-strength double-sided adhesive bonding tape. After cleaning the gutter thoroughly, the homeowner peels off the red backing strip and slides the back edge of the guard under the first row of roof shingles (if applicable and without lifting them forcefully, to avoid voiding roof warranties). The front edge is then pressed down firmly onto the front lip of the gutter, allowing the adhesive to bond. 2.
**Screw-On Method:** Alternatively, or in combination with the adhesive, the guards can be secured using self-tapping screws (often included in the kit). These screws drill directly through the aluminum frame of the gutter guard and into the front lip of the gutter. This method provides maximum stability, especially in windy areas.
**General Installation Steps (DIY):**
1. **Clean Gutters:** Crucially, all existing leaves, pine needles, shingle grit, and debris must be thoroughly removed from your gutters and downspouts before installation. 2. **Assess & Prepare:** Inspect your gutters for any damage or misalignment and make necessary minor repairs. 3. **Measure and Cut:** Measure your gutter lengths and cut the EasyOn Gutter Guard sections to fit using tin snips or heavy-duty scissors. Special cuts may be needed for corners. 4.
**Install:** Apply chosen installation method (adhesive, screws, or both), carefully positioning each section. The back edge is generally designed to slide under shingles or butt up against the fascia, while the front edge secures to the gutter lip. 5. **Overlap Sections:** Sections are designed to overlap neatly to create a continuous barrier.
While the process is DIY-friendly, homeowners should prioritize safety, use a stable ladder, and consider a ladder standoff. For multi-story homes or complex rooflines, hiring a handyman might be a safer option.

## Do Costco Gutter Guards Have a Warranty?
Yes, Costco's EasyOn Gutter Guards come with a notable warranty for a DIY product:

* **10-Year Limited Parts Warranty:** The product initially comes with a 10-year limited warranty covering manufacturing defects in the parts. This warranty is **not transferable** to subsequent owners. * **Extendable to 25 or 30 Years:** A significant benefit is the ability to **extend the product warranty by an additional 15 to 20 years (totaling 25 or 30 years)** by registering your product online with EasyOn Gutter Guard's manufacturer.
This extension is typically valid if the guards are installed correctly according to their instructions.
It's crucial to understand that this is a **parts-only warranty** and does **not** cover the cost of re-installation. Also, "coastal areas" may have reduced warranty periods (e.g., 5 years) due to increased exposure to corrosive elements. Always keep your original purchase receipt and register your product to activate the extended warranty.

* **Ice Buildup in Extreme Cold:** Like many gutter guards, in areas with severe winters, some users report snow or ice buildup on the surface which can momentarily impede water flow during thaws.

For homeowners seeking a cost-effective and relatively straightforward way to manage gutter debris, Costco offers a popular DIY solution in the form of EasyOn Gutter Guards. Unlike professionally installed systems that come with a hefty price tag, Costco's approach puts the power (and the labor) directly into the homeowner's hands. This makes them an attractive option for budget-conscious individuals comfortable with home improvement projects.

This article will delve into the specifics of Costco gutter guards, including what they are, how they're installed, their cost, warranty, maintenance, and what actual customers are saying. Our aim is to provide a clear picture to help you decide if these DIY guards are the right fit for your home.

##  What Are Costco Gutter Guards?

Costco primarily sells **EasyOn Gutter Guards**, which are a type of **micro-mesh gutter guard**. These are physical barriers designed to sit over your existing [gutters](https://pestpolicy.com/all-american-gutters-reviews/),preventing debris from entering while allowing rainwater to flow freely.

Key characteristics of EasyOn [Gutter](https://pestpolicy.com/are-gutters-necessary/)Guards:

* **Material: ** They feature a **surgical-grade stainless steel micro-mesh** screen affixed to a sturdy **aluminum frame**. This combination is chosen for its durability, rust resistance, and ability to block even very fine debris like pine needles, shingle grit, and seeds. * **Design: ** The micro-mesh is designed to sit on top of your gutters, creating a flat or slightly sloped surface.

This allows leaves and larger debris to sit on the mesh, dry out, and then be blown away by wind.

* **Compatibility: ** EasyOn Gutter Guards are designed to fit most standard 5-inch and 6-inch K-style gutters. * **DIY Product: ** They are sold in convenient lengths (e. g. , 24 ft or 100 ft rolls/sections) and are intended for homeowner installation.

##  How Much Do Costco Gutter Guards Cost?

One of the most appealing aspects of Costco gutter guards is their affordability compared to professionally installed systems. The cost typically varies based on the length and width (5-inch or 6-inch) of the guards you purchase.

Based on recent pricing, you can expect:

* **5-inch wide, 100-foot rolls/kits: ** Approximately $165 - $180 * **6-inch wide, 100-foot rolls/kits: ** Approximately $199 - $220 * Shorter lengths (e. g. , 24 ft) are also available at prorated costs.

This translates to a cost of roughly **$1. 65 to $2. 20 per linear foot**, making them significantly more budget-friendly than professional installations, which can range from $15 to $45 per linear foot. Remember, this price is for the materials only; installation labor is your responsibility unless you hire a handyman.

##  How To Maintain Costco Gutter Guards

While gutter guards significantly reduce the need for gutter cleaning, "maintenance-free" is a common misconception. Costco gutter guards, like most micro-mesh systems, will require **minimal, occasional maintenance** to ensure optimal performance.

Here's how to maintain them:

* **Brush Off Accumulated Debris: ** Over time, especially in areas with heavy tree cover, leaves, pine needles, and other debris may accumulate on top of the micro-mesh. Periodically, you might need to use a soft brush (often on an extension pole) to sweep this debris off. * **Rinse with Water: ** Fine shingle grit, pollen, or dust can sometimes settle into the mesh, potentially slowing water flow.

A strong stream of water from a garden hose can help rinse these particles away.

* **Inspect Periodically: ** After heavy storms, or at least once or twice a year, it's wise to visually inspect the guards from the ground or a ladder (safely! ) to ensure no sections have dislodged, warped, or become heavily clogged. * **Check Valleys: ** Roof valleys tend to channel a concentrated volume of water and debris. These areas might require more frequent attention to ensure the mesh doesn't get overloaded.

The goal is to prevent buildup on the *surface* of the guard, as the primary purpose of the micro-mesh is to keep the *inside* of the gutter clean. You generally won't need to remove the guards or clean inside the gutters unless there's an unusual buildup of silt or a rare system failure.

##  Final Thoughts: Are Costco Gutter Guards Worth It?

For the right homeowner, **Costco Gutter Guards (EasyOn Gutter Guard) are absolutely worth it. ** They offer a compelling combination of affordability, effective performance, and a respectable warranty for a DIY product.

**Costco Gutter Guards are an excellent choice if you: **

* **Are on a budget** and want to avoid the high cost of professionally installed gutter guard systems. * **Are comfortable with DIY home improvement projects**, including working safely on a ladder. * **Have common gutter types** (5-inch or 6-inch K-style) and a relatively straightforward roofline. * **Seek effective protection** against all types of debris, including fine particles like pine needles and shingle grit.

* **Want a durable product** made from rust-resistant materials like stainless steel and aluminum. * **Are willing to perform occasional, minimal surface maintenance** to keep the mesh clear.

They provide a practical and long-lasting solution to keep your gutters clear without breaking the bank. While they don't come with the full-service installation and "no-clog" labor guarantee of premium systems, their performance and value make them a standout option in the DIY gutter guard market. Always assess your comfort level with ladder work and your home's specific needs before committing to any DIY gutter protection.
