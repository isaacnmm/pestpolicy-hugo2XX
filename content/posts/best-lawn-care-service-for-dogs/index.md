## How Do I Choose the Best Lawn Care Service?

Selecting the right lawn care service, especially with dogs, requires careful consideration beyond just effectiveness.

* **Prioritize Pet Safety:** This should be your number one concern. Inquire about the specific products used, their ingredients, and how long pets need to stay off the lawn after application.
* **Understand Service Offerings:** Do you need basic fertilization, comprehensive weed and pest control, or specialized services like aeration or grub treatment? Ensure the company offers what you need.
* **Inquire About Product Types:** Ask if they offer natural, organic, or reduced-risk pesticide options if that's a preference.
* **Check Guarantees & Customer Service:** A strong satisfaction guarantee and responsive customer support are crucial for peace of mind.
* **Read Reviews:** Look for reviews specifically mentioning pet safety or communication regarding application.
* **Get Multiple Quotes:** Compare pricing and program details from several companies to ensure you're getting the best value.

## Considerations for a Lawn Care Service for Dogs

When your furry friend shares the yard, these specific factors become vital in your lawn care decisions:

* **Product Ingredients & Toxicity:**
    * **Avoid Harmful Chemicals:** Be wary of broad-spectrum pesticides and herbicides that list highly toxic ingredients. Look for companies that use EPA-registered products with low toxicity ratings, or those that focus on natural/organic solutions.
    * **Understanding "Pet-Friendly":** Many companies claim "pet-friendly" because their products are safe *once dry*. Understand that this still means keeping your dog off the lawn for a period.
* **Application Methods & Drying Times:**
    * **Granular vs. Liquid:** Liquid applications typically dry faster than granular, often allowing re-entry within 1-4 hours. Granular products might require longer or specific watering to dissolve them into the soil before it's safe for pets.
    * **Clear Communication:** The service provider should clearly communicate when it's safe for your dog to return to the lawn after each treatment. Get this information in writing or via a clear notification system.
* **Managing Dog Urine Spots:**
    * While not directly related to product safety, dog urine can cause brown spots due to high nitrogen concentration. Some services offer soil amendments or specific treatments to help mitigate these.
    * Consider products designed to neutralize urine spots or encourage more tolerant grass types in high-traffic areas.
* **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):**
    * Ask if the company uses an IPM approach, which prioritizes non-chemical methods and targeted pesticide application only when necessary, reducing overall chemical exposure.
* **Organic/Natural Options:**
    * If you want to minimize all chemical exposure, explicitly seek out services that offer certified organic or all-natural lawn care programs. These rely on biological and natural substances for fertilization and pest/weed management.
