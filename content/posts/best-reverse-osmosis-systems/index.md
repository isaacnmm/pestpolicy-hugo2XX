### [**3. Home Master TMAFC Artesian**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005A3WM6C/?tag=p-policy-20)
Home Master TMAFC Artesian is the first choice when it comes to solving your RO system problems.
In comparison to the traditional reverse osmosis system, fittings and tubing of Home Master TMAFC Artesian are relatively large.
It makes good use of its systematic 7-stage filtration, which gives you clean and pure water. What makes this RO system different from the rest are its two magnificent features:
The purified water by this filter comes with a blended taste. Its slightly acidic nature plus the dissolved minerals make this taste possible.
- It never stops at that; useful minerals are again added back to the water after the filtration, which in turn adds the water pH to alkaline.
- This results in a fresher and tastier mineral water which is loved by many people.
Its other fantastic feature is the permeate pump. This pump does not use electricity but can emulate water pressure before entering the filters.
The method helps in water waste reduction by up to 80%, which in turn increases the production of water up to 50%. If you are a city dweller, then this feature should be essential.
Pros:
- Improved RO system
- Increased water flow rate to faucets
- 7-stage filtration
- Easily changeable filters
- Easy installment and set up
Cons:

## **Consider for Best Reverse Osmosis Systems**
Are you in requirement of an air gap faucet or air gap? Faucets with no air gap have no air gap to help in the prevention of siphoning drained water back to the system.
Nonetheless, faucets with no air gap are easy to install with less noise and an installed check valve to prevent drain backflow; hence the most common faucet is that with no air gap.
- How many filtration stages should be in an RO system? Typically RO systems come in either 5. 4 or 3 filtration stages.
- The most recommended is the one with four stages, which has the most applications.
However, should you be in a place with high sediment levels or well water, consider purchasing the one with five stages that have a pre-filtration?
It is essential to know that RO systems with 4 or 5 stages provide filtration adequacy in most applications.
- What of water hardness? The question here is, does the water which is incoming have a level of hardness over 7 grains in a gallon (gpg)?
- Be aware that an RO system does not soften water; however, pretreatment of water softener, which will aid in membrane and RO system life preservation should your water possess over seven hardness of gpg, which is not necessarily meaningful.
**Do RO Systems Waste Water? **
Just like our common water usage every day to wash dishes, clothes, and ourselves, the technology of RO systems use water to cleanse RO membranes in the process of processing water.
- On the process of filtration, typically, RO systems use a lot of water in comparison to the filtered water which it produces.
Nevertheless, when the storage tank is filled, the whole system shuts off; thus, water stops running down the drain. For the entire point, other methods are water-efficient in comparison to other systems.
**What is the amount of water that a system can produce? **
A GPD has a 50%-70% rate of water. Of course, no human can consume 50 or more gallons, but the GPD rating of 50 is the average speed drinking water is made by RO system with a gallon output per hour and 60 psi water pressure.
So a rated system of 50 GPD provides a product that is adequate and way cheaper.
**Is RO water suitable for the ice maker? **
To acquire ice, all you got to do is add a kit of icemaker adapters to get icemaker RO water. You no longer require another refrigerator filter.
## Conclusion
You know that nothing is perfect, right? So do not hurry to purchase to find the best and the perfect one among all of them.
- But forget all that, the merits of RO water are way more massive than the demerits. It is incredibly worth it to consume clean, purified water to lead healthy lives.
Having full knowledge, it is my hope that you can easily decide on the RO system that you can purchase and install.
The products which are listed above should assure you of excellent filtration abilities as well as additional features like installment ease and innovative design.
