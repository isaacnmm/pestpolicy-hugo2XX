In this post, I've reviewed Harris Boric Acid powder as an effective roach killer. Harris Boric Acid is a historic roach control method, at least the composition's chemical side. In addition to killing roaches, the boric acid powder will also exterminate other bugs such as silverfish, palmetto bugs, and water bugs. Boric Acid is highly effective in killing roaches yet also budget-friendly and thus topping the best roach killers available today.

# # Special lure/ Attractant

Harris [boric acid contains a unique lure thatll attract the roaches](https: //pestpolicy. com/does-boric-acid-kill-roaches/) to the poison and trick it into feeding o its death.

The included straw has a tube-like design thatll allow the homeowner to place the roach killing powders to the deepest of the cracks and crevices. But, being a chemical, boric acid must not be ingested by humans, pets, and livestock as it can be poisonous to them.

# # Is Boric Acid roach killer Safe for Humans & Pets?

Despite that this roach killer is highly toxic to roaches and other insects such as fleas and bed bugs, the products have low-toxicity levels that would not poison humans and pets (either cats or dogs). Therefore, [roach acid will be safe around pets](https: //pestpolicy. com/pet-safe-roach-killer/) and humans if it's in low dosages. Further, boric acid causes no carcinogenic impacts on the roaches.

However, the boric acid powder must not be used near breastfeeding or nursing women.

# # **CompareBorax vs.Boric Acid**

First things first, both borax and boric acid are extracted from the mineral boron. Further, you can both of these chemicals to kill roaches and other insects. But borax is used in toothpaste, laundry detergent, or dish soap and kills mildew and molds as a suitable fungicide. Therefore, borax incorporated in the regular use products comes in low quantities and will pose minimal risk to both pets and human beings.

However, you must follow the product label instructions before using this boric acid powder to kill insects such as roaches.
