Even the most well-maintained lawns can eventually show signs of wear and tear, whether it's from heavy foot traffic, environmental stressors, or the natural aging process of grass. When your lawn starts looking thin, patchy, or simply lacks its former vibrancy, you might consider reseeding. But what exactly does that entail, and how much will it set you back?

This comprehensive guide will break down the costs associated with reseeding or seeding a lawn, clarify the differences between common terms, explore the factors influencing price, discuss grass seed options, and help you decide whether to tackle the project yourself or hire a professional.

##  Cost to Seed Your Lawn

The cost to seed a lawn can vary significantly depending on whether you're overseeding (adding new seed to existing grass) or seeding a brand-new lawn from scratch. On average, homeowners can expect to pay anywhere from **$0. 04 to $0. 18 per square foot** for overseeding or reseeding, while seeding a completely new lawn can range from **$0. 25 to $0. 70 per square foot** due to more intensive preparation.

For a typical 5, 000 to 10, 000 square foot lawn:

* **DIY Overseeding (Seed Only): ** $50 $200 * **Professional Overseeding/Reseeding: ** $200 $1, 350 * **Seeding a New Lawn (Professional, including prep): ** $1, 250 $7, 000 (for 5, 000 to 10, 000 sq ft)

These figures generally include materials and labor for professional services, while DIY costs are primarily for seed and potentially rental equipment.

##  Reseeding Vs. Overseeding: What's the Difference?

While often used interchangeably, "reseeding" and "overseeding" have distinct meanings in lawn care, and understanding the difference impacts cost.

* **Overseeding: ** This involves spreading new grass seed over an *existing* lawn to improve its density, fill in minor thin spots, and introduce new, stronger grass varieties. The existing grass provides some protection for the new seedlings. Preparation typically involves mowing low, dethatching, and aerating. * **Reseeding (Partial or Patching): ** This term often refers to seeding specific *bare or damaged patches* within an existing lawn.

It's more targeted than overseeding the entire lawn but still aims to fill in gaps. Preparation for these specific areas might involve removing dead grass, loosening soil, and adding topsoil. * **Seeding a New Lawn: ** This is the most extensive and costly option.

It involves preparing a *completely bare area* (e. g. , after construction, removing old turf, or in a new home build) from scratch, which typically includes grading, tilling, soil amendments, and then seeding the entire area.

This article primarily focuses on costs associated with both overseeding and reseeding existing lawns, with a section dedicated to the process of seeding a completely new lawn.

##  What Affects the Cost of Reseeding?

Several factors can significantly influence the total cost of reseeding your lawn:

1. **Lawn Size: ** This is the most obvious factor. Larger lawns require more seed, more labor, and potentially larger equipment, directly increasing costs. 2. **Current Lawn Condition: ** A lawn with severe compaction, excessive thatch, a high weed population, or significant bare spots will require more extensive preparation (aeration, dethatching, weed removal, topsoil) before seeding, driving up labor and material costs. 3.

**Grass Seed Type: ** Different grass varieties have vastly different price points. Premium, specialty blends or those with advanced coatings will be more expensive than common varieties. 4. **DIY vs. Professional Service: ** Doing it yourself will save on labor costs but requires your time, effort, and potentially equipment rentals. Hiring a professional includes their expertise, specialized equipment, and labor. 5.

**Preparation Work: ** * **Aeration: ** $0. 10 - $0. 35 per sq ft (professional) * **Dethatching: ** $100 - $400 for a typical lawn (professional) * **Topsoil/Compost: ** $10 - $50 per cubic yard * **Weed Treatment: ** $110 - $325 (professional) 6. **Additional Services: ** Applying starter fertilizer, disease control, pest control, or post-seeding watering services will add to the overall expense. 7.

**Location: ** Labor costs and material prices vary by region and local market demand.

Urban areas often have higher prices than rural ones. 8. **Seeding Method: ** While overseeding generally uses broadcast spreaders, more intensive methods like slice seeding or hydroseeding (applying a slurry of seed, mulch, fertilizer, and water) can be more expensive per square foot but may offer better germination rates or be necessary for sloped areas.

##  Grass Seed Costs by Type

The type of grass you choose is a major cost factor. Prices are typically per pound, but coverage varies greatly by seed type.

* **Bermudagrass: ** $1. 50 - $12. 00 per pound. Best for warm climates, full sun, and high traffic. * **Fescue (Tall Fescue, Fine Fescue): ** $1. 50 - $10. 00 per pound. Versatile, good for cool-season and transition zones, varying sun tolerances. * **Kentucky Bluegrass: ** $6. 00 - $12. 00+ per pound. Known for its beautiful color and density but is slower to establish and more expensive. Best for cool climates. * **Perennial Ryegrass: ** $1.

00 - $5. 00 per pound.

Quick germination, often used in mixes or for temporary winter green-up in warm climates. * **Zoysiagrass: ** $10. 00 - $20. 00+ per pound. More expensive and slower to establish, but drought-tolerant and forms a dense, low-maintenance lawn in warm climates. (Often available as plugs or sod, which are more costly than seed). * **Bahiagrass: ** $5. 00 - $10. 00 per pound.

Common in the deep South, very drought-tolerant, and low maintenance, but has a coarser texture.

Keep in mind that seed blends (e. g. , "Sun & Shade Mix") often combine different types to suit various conditions.

##  Grass Seed Costs by Brand

Major brands like Scotts, Pennington, and Jonathan Green offer a range of products, from basic mixes to specialized, high-performance blends. Prices can vary significantly based on the type of grass, added features (e. g. , fertilizer coatings, mulch), and bag size.

* **Scotts: ** Often range from **$20 - $70+ for smaller bags (5-20 lbs)**, with larger bags and specialized products (like their "Thick'R Lawn" or "Rapid Grass" with added fertilizer/soil improvers) being higher. For example, a 5. 6 lb bag of Scotts Tall Fescue Mix might be around $25-$30, while a 40 lb bag could be $100-$150+. * **Pennington: ** Similar to Scotts, Pennington offers various mixes.

A 7 lb bag of their Smart Seed Sun and Shade mix might cost **$20 - $30**, with larger 20 lb bags ranging from **$50 - $80+**. Their "Smart Patch" products (seed, mulch, fertilizer combos) for bare spot repair are often in the $15-$35 range for smaller quantities. * **Jonathan Green: ** Known for their "Black Beauty" lines, which are often considered premium blends.

Prices can start around **$12 - $20 for a 1-3 lb bag**, going up to **$50 - $100+ for 25 lb bags** depending on the specific blend (e. g. , Ultra, Dense Shade, Sunny).

These are general ranges, and prices can fluctuate based on promotions, retailers, and specific product formulations.

##  How to Seed a New Lawn (Complete Renovation)

Seeding a completely new lawn from scratch is a more involved process than overseeding. Here are the general steps:

1. **Clear the Area: ** Remove all existing vegetation (weeds, old grass, debris). This might involve manual removal, herbicides, or sod cutters. 2. **Rough Grade: ** Level the area, ensuring proper drainage away from structures. Fill in low spots and smooth out high spots. For significant grading, professional help might be needed. 3. **Soil Preparation: ** * **Soil Test: ** Essential to understand nutrient levels and pH.

* **Till the Soil: ** Loosen the top 4-6 inches of soil using a tiller.

* **Amendments: ** Based on soil test results, incorporate compost, topsoil, or other amendments to improve soil structure and fertility. 4. **Fine Grade: ** Rake the area smooth, ensuring a level, firm seedbed. Remove any remaining rocks or clumps. 5. **Apply Starter Fertilizer: ** Use a starter fertilizer specifically designed for new lawns, which is high in phosphorus. 6. **Spread Seed: ** Use a broadcast spreader for even distribution.

Apply half the seed in one direction and the other half perpendicularly for uniform coverage. 7. **Lightly Rake & Roll: ** Lightly rake the seed into the top 1/8 to 1/4 inch of soil to ensure good seed-to-soil contact. Gently roll the area with a lawn roller (partially filled with water for lighter pressure) to press seeds firmly into the soil. 8. **Mulch (Optional but Recommended): ** Apply a thin layer of straw (weed-free! )

or a specialized seed accelerator mulch.

This helps retain moisture, prevents erosion, and deters birds. 9. **Water Religiously: ** This is critical. Keep the seedbed consistently moist with light, frequent watering (2-4 times a day) until germination occurs and the grass is established (typically 2-4 weeks). Gradually reduce frequency and increase duration as the grass grows. 10. **First Mow: ** Wait until the new grass is about 3-4 inches tall before its first mow.

Use a sharp blade and only remove the top one-third of the blade height.

##  Grass Alternatives: Low-Maintenance Lawn Options

For homeowners seeking to reduce the long-term cost and effort of traditional grass lawns, several low-maintenance alternatives exist:

* **Clover: ** White clover can be overseeded into existing lawns or planted as a groundcover. It's drought-tolerant, nitrogen-fixing (reduces fertilizer needs), and attracts pollinators. **Cost: ** Roughly $4-$8 per pound. * **Groundcovers (e. g. , Creeping Thyme, Sedum, Creeping Phlox): ** These spread to form a dense mat, often requiring minimal mowing and less water once established.

**Cost: ** Highly variable, from $5-$15 per plant or specialized seed mixes ranging from $20-$100+ for smaller coverage areas. * **Native Grasses/Wildflower Mixes: ** Adapted to local climates, these often require less water and fertilizer. They also support local wildlife. **Cost: ** Varies widely, from **$15-$50+ per pound** for seed mixes.

* **Artificial Turf: ** High upfront cost (**$5-$20+ per square foot installed**) but virtually zero maintenance, water, or fertilizer costs long-term.

* **Mulch or Hardscaping: ** Converting high-maintenance lawn areas to mulch beds, rock gardens, or patios reduces all lawn-related costs, though initial installation can be significant.

While the upfront cost for these alternatives can sometimes be higher than seeding, they typically offer substantial savings in water, fertilizer, mowing, and pest control over the long run.

##  Should You Hire a Professional or DIY Your Lawn Seeding?

The decision to DIY or hire a professional depends on your budget, time, skill level, and the scope of the project.

**DIY Lawn Seeding: **

* **
Pros:

- ** Significantly lower cost (primarily materials and equipment rental). Provides a sense of accomplishment. You control the timing and materials. * **Cons: ** Requires research, time, and physical effort. Mistakes (improper prep, watering, or seed choice) can lead to poor results and wasted money. You may lack specialized equipment (aerator, slit seeder).

* **Best For: ** Small patches, overseeding a relatively healthy lawn, or those with prior experience and the necessary time commitment.

**Hiring a Professional: **

* **
Pros:

- ** Expertise ensures proper preparation, seed selection, and application for optimal results. Saves time and labor. Access to commercial-grade equipment. Professionals often guarantee their work. * **Cons: ** Higher overall cost (including labor and markup on materials). Less control over scheduling.

* **Best For: ** Seeding a new lawn, large areas, lawns with significant issues (compaction, grading problems), or if you lack the time, equipment, or confidence to do it yourself.

For major projects like a full lawn renovation, the investment in a professional often pays off in better success rates and fewer headaches. For simple overseeding, DIY can be a very viable and cost-effective option.

##  FAQs About Reseeding Costs

**Q: How much does it cost to reseed a 1, 000 square foot lawn? ** A: For DIY overseeding (seed only), roughly $10-$20. For professional overseeding, it could range from $40-$180. If seeding a new lawn of that size, expect $250-$700 professionally.

**Q: Is it cheaper to reseed or lay sod? ** A: Seeding is almost always cheaper than laying sod. Sod typically costs $1. 50 to $4. 00 per square foot installed, while seeding ranges from $0. 04 to $0. 70 per square foot. Sod offers instant results, while seed requires patience and consistent care.

**Q: What is the most expensive part of reseeding a lawn? ** A: For a full new lawn, the most expensive parts are typically extensive site preparation (grading, soil amendments) and professional labor. For overseeding, the cost of specialized grass seed can be a significant portion.

**Q: Does reseeding include starter fertilizer? ** A: If you hire a professional, they will typically include starter fertilizer. For DIY, you will need to purchase and apply starter fertilizer separately, which is a crucial step for successful germination.

**Q: Can I reseed my lawn in the summer? ** A: It is generally not recommended, especially for cool-season grasses, as young seedlings struggle with high summer heat and drought. Late summer/early fall is best for cool-season grasses, and late spring/early summer for warm-season grasses.
