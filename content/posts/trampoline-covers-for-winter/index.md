##  **Considerations in Trampoline Covers for Winter**

###  **1. How Severe Is The Weather In Your Area?**

It is important to note that each part of the world experiences a different weather pattern. For example, some places might get heavy snows during winter while others minimal or none. Other areas may experience heavy rains or storms while others minimal to none. So its upon you to know the magnitude of snow or weather conditions you usually experience in your area.

If adequately covered, your trampoline can withstand the test of time and weather, and even maintain its original new look.

Before making that ultimate choice of buying the best trampoline cover, there are a few things you need to consider. Hence, weve outlined what you need to consider before purchasing a trampoline.

###  **2. Type Of Trampoline **

What type of trampoline is in your backyard? It is good to note that its quite tricky to get covers for square trampolines, oval trampolines, and springless trampolines. Therefore, if you own any of these trampolines, you might need to modify the already available covers to fit your structure. For instance, if you own an in-ground trampoline and you need a cover for it; you can buy the usual trampoline cover installed on above-ground trampolines.

Just enlarge the holes to enable secure attachment on the hooks of the cover. For a springless trampoline, you should purchase a cover that is a little larger than your structure to make it easy to attach to the metal frame of your trampoline. Further, Trampoline covers make it easier to remove snow that may accumulate on top of your trampoline.

Heavy snow can be a risk factor for a trampoline as it makes the springs and nets overstretch losing their elasticity, thus making the jumping surface a danger zone. Trampoline Covers are an essential investment. Choosing one that would adequately protect your trampoline from harsh winter or other severe weather should be your priority.

###  **3. Get Correct Measurement of Your Trampoline **

Before you decide on the kind of weather cover you need, take your trampoline measurements. These measurements will guarantee that you get the right cover size of your structure. Trampolines are made in a variety of sizes and shapes like oval, rectangular, or round among other shapes. Their diameters can vary from 7ft to 16 ft.

The bottom line is: Take correct measurements to get the right cover size for your trampoline. If youre uncertain about the size or diameter of your trampoline, check the manufacturers manual and get the correct dimensions of your structure. Buying a small cover means that youll have to overstretch it to fit the trampoline. Hence, it can get damaged, while a bigger one might not look to the frame as required.

But, with regular snow removal, all this can be avoided.

The trampoline covers make routine removal of snow an easier task. Furthermore, trampoline covers protect your trampoline from harsh weather. So the damage is minimized.
