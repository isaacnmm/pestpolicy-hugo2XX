##  Why do Wasps Sting?

The reason why you were struck with a wasps sting was probably that you unconsciously posed an imminent danger in some way. In other words, know that a wasp will attack you the moment it senses a fearful or threatening situation.

But a fearful situation can occur at anytime so why do the wasps mostly sting during summers? This is because female wasps tend to hibernate and lay eggs during winters.

They start producing new colonies in spring which then breaks down and disperse as soon as summers arrive. In the start, these dispersed, or worker wasps, are disoriented and so end up going in search of sweetened food and drinks. This, in turn, increases your chance of being exposed to wasps.

If you have wasps near your house, you would have noticed that their activity reduces at night. This is because wasps sleep at night and wake up to the slightest exposure of light even if its just your flashlight!

##  The Stinging Habit of Wasps

Being carnivores, wasps are very active when it comes to hunting. But they can also sting and defend themselves multiple times if they are aggravated or alarmed. This is because they dont lose their stinger when they sting. With each sting is some venom released, but its amount varies between wasps depending on how much each can hold in their body.

The only time they may not sting more than once is if they run out of venom. They can only sting again once the venom has regenerated. Some species of wasps are also capable of biting in addition to stinging when they feel attacked. But most resort to simply stinging in their attempts to deter humans who threaten their safety.

An interesting thing to note is that the male wasps dont sting at all. This is because it is not physically possible for them to do so. Male wasps dont have a stinger and hence are neither too aggressive nor too protective their sole purpose is to breed or pollinate.

Female wasps, on the other hand, are in charge of safeguarding their territory. Every time it stings, a female wasp also releases a pheromone that lets other female wasps know that it needs help.

So in case you thought a wasp stung you more than once, it was probably a whole pack of female wasps hinting you to run away!

##  What Happens When a Wasp Stings?

Even in instances where wasps stung you more than once, keep in mind that they are not meant to kill you. Human deaths from wasp stings are incredibly rare. But the wasp stings do cause allergic reactions and immense pain.

The symptoms of a wasp sting can be grouped into three kinds of reactions:

###  Normal local reactions

Majority of the non-allergic victims of wasp stings who face normal local reactions. It refers to developing a raised welt around the sting site with a small white mark in the location where the wasp attacked. Even though this is painful at the moment, but the swelling and pain go away after sometime.

###  Large local reactions

If you are allergic to stings, you are likely to face more pronounced symptoms of a wasp sting. Large local reactions are more painful than normal local reactions but they are not life-threatening. They include: - Extreme redness - Swelling that keeps increasing 2-3 days after the sting - Nausea - Vomiting Large local reactions subside on their own within 2-3 weeks but you can opt for treatment for fast recovery.

###  Severe allergic reactions

The most severe and alarming reactions to wasp stings are called anaphylaxis. This appears in people with sting allergy and needs immediate medical attention. Anaphylaxis occurs in response to the venom that has entered the body, resulting in a shock.

Someone with anaphylaxis will face some or all of the following symptoms: - Swelled face, lips, throat - Lightheadedness and dizziness - Diarrhea or stomach cramps - Decreased blood pressure - Itching in parts of the body that are unaffected by the sting - A feeling of nausea or vomiting - Difficulty in breathing

##  How to Treat Wasp Stings?

How long the symptoms of wasp sting last depends on the way you treat the sting. As soon as you or someone near you gets stung by a wasp, you should get a clean cloth to wipe off the sting area. While most wasps dont normally leave the sting behind, make sure to check out for any sting in the affected area and remove it immediately.
