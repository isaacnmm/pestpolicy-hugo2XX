If you have a mouse infestation in your home, you may be wondering how much it will cost to hire an [exterminator](https://pestpolicy.com/how-much-do-spider-exterminators-cost/)to handle the problem. The price for hiring a professional exterminator can vary based on several factors, including the severity of the infestation, the type of service provided, and the location.

In this article, we will explore the typical costs associated with hiring an exterminator for [mice](https://pestpolicy.com/best-poison-for-mouse/)and what you can expect during the process.

##  Factors That Affect the Cost of Exterminating Mice

Several factors can influence the cost of extermination services for mice, including: - **Size of the infestation: **The larger the infestation, the higher the cost. A few mice may only require a one-time treatment, while a larger infestation may need multiple visits and more intensive treatments.

- **Type of service: **Exterminators may offer different types of services, such as one-time treatments, monthly visits, or ongoing pest control programs.

The more extensive the service, the higher the cost. - **Location: **The cost of extermination can vary based on where you live. Urban areas or regions with a high demand for pest control services may charge more compared to rural areas. - **Size of your home: **The larger your home, the more it will cost to treat. Exterminators typically charge based on the square footage of your home or the number of rooms that need to be treated.

##  Average Cost of Hiring an Exterminator for Mice

On average, you can expect to pay anywhere from $100 to $600 to hire an exterminator for mice. Here is a breakdown of the typical costs based on different types of services: - **One-time treatment: **A one-time treatment for mice typically costs between $100 and $300. This service usually includes a thorough inspection of your home, placement of traps or bait, and removal of any dead rodents.

- **Ongoing services: **If you opt for ongoing pest control services, you may pay anywhere from $200 to $600 for a treatment plan that involves multiple visits. This may include routine inspections and treatments to ensure that the infestation does not return. - **Inspection and assessment fees: **Some exterminators charge a separate fee for an initial inspection and assessment, which can range from $50 to $200.

This cost may be included in the overall treatment price or charged separately.

##  Additional Costs to Consider

In addition to the base price for extermination services, there are other potential costs to consider: - **Repairs and exclusions: **In some cases, you may need to repair holes or cracks in your home that mice are using to enter. Exterminators may offer exclusion services, such as sealing entry points, which can add to the total cost of the treatment.

- **Follow-up visits: **Depending on the severity of the infestation, you may need follow-up visits to ensure that the mice have been completely eradicated. These visits can cost $50 to $150 each, depending on the service provider and location. - **Rodent-proofing: **Some exterminators may offer rodent-proofing services, which involve making your home less inviting to mice in the future.

This can include sealing gaps, installing barriers, and setting up preventative measures.

The cost for these services can range from $200 to $1, 000, depending on the size of your home and the level of work required.

##  DIY vs. Professional Extermination

If you are trying to save money, you may be tempted to handle the mouse infestation yourself. While there are many DIY solutions available, such as traps, baits, and repellents, hiring a professional exterminator is often the more effective option. Here are some pros and cons of DIY versus professional extermination: - **DIY: **DIY solutions can be less expensive upfront, but they may not fully eliminate the infestation.

Mice can be difficult to trap, and an incomplete solution may lead to a recurring problem. - **Professional extermination: **Professional exterminators have the experience and tools to effectively identify the source of the infestation and eradicate it. While it is more expensive, you are more likely to get long-lasting results and avoid the need for multiple treatments.

##  Tips for Reducing the Cost of Mice Extermination

While hiring an exterminator can be expensive, there are ways to reduce the overall cost of the service: - **Schedule a consultation: **Many exterminators offer free consultations or inspections. Take advantage of these services to get an estimate of the cost before committing to treatment.

- **Bundle services: **If you need other pest control services (such as for ants or termites), you may be able to bundle them with your mouse treatment for a discounted price.

- **Preventative measures: **Taking preventative steps to keep mice out of your home, such as sealing entry points, keeping food stored properly, and removing clutter, can reduce the need for professional extermination services in the future.

##  Conclusion

The cost of hiring an exterminator for mice can range from $100 to $600, depending on factors such as the size of the infestation, the type of service provided, and your location. While DIY solutions may be less expensive initially, hiring a professional exterminator is often the most effective way to eliminate a mouse infestation and prevent future problems.

By understanding the costs involved and taking steps to prevent infestations, you can keep your home mouse-free and avoid unnecessary expenses in the future.
