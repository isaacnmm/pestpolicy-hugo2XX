Staining Deck](https://pestpolicy.com/painting-vs-staining-deck/)**Step 1: Ventilate the area** The first step in getting rid of the spray paint smell is to open up windows and doors to ventilate the area as much as possible.

This will help to dissipate the odor and bring in the fresh air.

If the weather is nice, consider opening windows on opposite sides of the room to create a cross breeze. This will help to circulate the air and speed up the process of getting rid of the smell.

This will help to distribute the odor and make it less concentrated.

If you don't have a fan, you can also use a portable air purifier with a HEPA filter, which will help to remove the smell from the air. **Step 3: Use white vinegar** White vinegar is a natural odor absorber and can be used to neutralize the smell of spray paint. To use it, simply place bowls of white vinegar around the room.

The acetic acid in the vinegar will help to neutralize the odor of the spray paint. You can also add a few drops of essential oils to the vinegar, such as lemon or eucalyptus, for an added boost of freshness.

Sprinkle baking soda on carpets and upholstered furniture, and let it sit for a few hours before vacuuming it up. Baking soda has the ability to absorb odors and will help to neutralize the smell of the spray paint. **Step 5: Use a deodorizing spray** If the smell of spray paint is particularly strong, you may want to consider using a deodorizing spray specifically formulated for paint odors.

These sprays contain enzymes and bacteria that neutralize paint odors. Be sure to follow the instructions on the label and spray the product directly onto the surfaces that have been painted.

You can find activated charcoal in the form of small bags or pellets, which can be placed in bowls or left open in the room. Activated charcoal will absorb the paint smell from the air and neutralize it. **Step 7: Clean surfaces with white vinegar** To remove any leftover residue that may be contributing to the odor, clean the surfaces that have been painted with a solution of 1 cup of white vinegar and 1 cup of water.

This will help to remove any traces of paint and neutralize the smell. Be sure to use gloves and a mask while doing this step if the smell is still very strong. **Step 8: Repeat as needed** It may take a few days for the odor to completely dissipate, so be patient and repeat steps 1-7 as needed until the odor is completely gone.

It's important to note that if the smell of spray paint is very strong, it's best to use proper ventilation and mask while doing these steps to avoid inhaling. See Also: Best Paint Stripper for Metal
