## The "Extra Tall" Advantage: Beyond Comfort Height
Kohler offers a range of toilet heights to cater to diverse user needs. While "Comfort Height" (or chair height) toilets typically sit around 16.5 to 17.5 inches from the floor to the top of the bowl (without the seat), the **Highline Arc Extra Tall toilet elevates this even further, often reaching 19 inches from the floor to the top of the bowl**.
This additional height provides a significant advantage for:

* **Taller Individuals:** Minimizes the strain of bending excessively to sit down. * **Seniors:** Makes sitting and standing much easier, reducing pressure on knees and hips. * **Individuals with Mobility Issues:** Offers greater independence and reduces the effort required to use the toilet. * **Anyone Seeking Enhanced Comfort:** Provides a more natural, chair-like seating position.
It's important to note that while the "Extra Tall" height offers considerable comfort benefits, it may not be ideal for very short individuals or young children, who might find it too high. Always consider the primary users of the bathroom when choosing a toilet height.

## Flushing Power and Water Efficiency: The Class Five Canister Flush
Beneath its tall and elegant exterior, the Kohler Highline Arc Extra Tall toilet houses a powerful and efficient flushing system:

* **Class Five Flushing Technology:** This is Kohler's proprietary gravity-fed flushing system. It's designed to deliver "virtually plug-free performance" and superior rinsing power for a clean bowl. Key to this system is the large 3-inch canister flush valve, which creates a rapid, strong siphon for waste removal. Unlike traditional flapper systems, the canister valve rotates 360 degrees, allowing water to flow from every direction into the bowl for a powerful, consistent flush.

* **WaterSense Certified (1.28 GPF):** Most Highline Arc Extra Tall models are WaterSense certified by the EPA, meaning they use 1.28 gallons per flush (GPF) or less. This significantly reduces water consumption compared to older, less efficient toilets (which could use 3.5 GPF or more), potentially saving thousands of gallons of water per year and lowering your utility bills. Despite the low GPF, the Class Five technology ensures that performance is not compromised.

If your household includes taller individuals, seniors, or anyone who would benefit from an easier sitting and standing experience, this toilet is a top contender. Its water-saving efficiency also makes it an environmentally conscious and cost-effective choice in the long run.
While it is a two-piece design, which might be a minor aesthetic compromise for some compared to sleek one-piece skirted toilets, its robust performance, durable construction, and the sheer comfort of its elevated height often outweigh this consideration. As with any plumbing fixture, ensure the rough-in measurement matches your existing setup for a smooth installation.

When selecting a new toilet, functionality, efficiency, and comfort are paramount. For many, a standard-height toilet can present challenges, especially for taller individuals, the elderly, or those with mobility issues. [Kohler](https://pestpolicy.com/kohler-rethinks-bathroom-medicine-cabinets-with-maxstow-model/),a renowned leader in plumbing fixtures, addresses this need with its **Highline Arc Extra Tall Toilet**.

Part of their bestselling Highline family, this model combines Kohler's reputation for quality with an elevated design focused on enhanced accessibility and powerful flushing.

The "Extra Tall" feature distinguishes this toilet from standard or even "Comfort Height" models, providing an even more accessible seating option. Coupled with the Highline Arc's distinctive design and efficient flushing technology, it aims to deliver a superior user experience. Let's explore the features, benefits, and considerations of the Kohler Highline Arc Extra Tall Toilet to help you determine if it's the right choice for your bathroom.

##  Design and Aesthetics: The Highline Arc Series

The Highline Arc series is recognized for its blend of traditional styling with modern sensibilities. Key design elements include:

* **Elegant Flared Tank: ** The tank often features a distinctive, subtly flared design that gives the toilet a refined and classic yet contemporary appearance. * **Two-Piece Construction: ** While some Highline models may come in a one-piece design, the "Highline Arc Extra Tall" is typically a two-piece toilet (separate tank and bowl).

This makes it generally lighter per component for easier maneuvering during installation compared to a heavy one-piece unit.

* **Vitreous China Material: ** Like most quality toilets, it's crafted from vitreous china, a durable, non-porous ceramic material that is resistant to stains, scratches, and chips, making it easy to clean and maintain its pristine white (or biscuit) finish. * **Bowl Shape Options: ** The Highline Arc Extra Tall is commonly available with an **elongated bowl**, which offers added comfort and seating room compared to a round-front bowl.

An elongated bowl is generally preferred in master bathrooms or larger spaces.

##  Convenience and Installation

Kohler often offers its Highline Arc toilets as part of their "Complete Solution" package. This means that the toilet comes in a single box with everything needed for installation, including:

* **Bowl and Tank: ** The main components. * **Slow-Close Toilet Seat: ** A popular feature that prevents slamming and reduces wear and tear. * **Wax Ring: ** For sealing the toilet to the floor drain. * **Floor Hardware: ** Bolts and caps for securing the toilet to the floor.

This "all-in-one" approach simplifies the purchasing process and ensures you have all necessary components, which is particularly beneficial for DIYers. Standard 12-inch rough-in is common, making it compatible with most existing bathroom plumbing configurations.

Installation for a two-piece toilet, while requiring careful handling, is generally straightforward for those with basic plumbing knowledge or a willingness to follow instructions closely.

##  Cons and Considerations

* **Height May Not Suit Everyone: ** As mentioned, the extra height can be inconvenient for very short individuals or young children, potentially requiring a step stool. * **Two-Piece Design: ** While easier to maneuver piece by piece during installation, two-piece toilets do have a seam between the tank and bowl that can accumulate dust and grime, making them slightly less easy to clean than a one-piece skirted toilet.

* **Cost: ** While offering excellent value for a Kohler product with these features, it will typically be more expensive than basic, standard-height toilets from budget brands. * **Bowl Cleaning: ** Some users of high-efficiency toilets occasionally report lower water levels in the bowl, which *might* require more frequent brushing to keep the bowl perfectly clean, depending on usage.
