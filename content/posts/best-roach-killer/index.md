## **Factors To Consider for Best Roach Killerï¿½**
I have already reviewed the best cockroach killers in the market. But theres one more thing! Lets look at some of the considerations you should bear in mind before you go shopping for cockroach pesticides.
### **Strength**
Usually, the strength of cockroach killers depends on the form in which it takes.
While some pesticides last for a few weeks, others may last up to a year. Traps last longer than sprays, while sprays last longer than powders.
### **Targeted Pests **
Not all pesticides are formulated for cockroaches. So when buying pest killers, choose the ones that are meant to attract and kill cockroaches.
Even better, choose pesticides that are formulated to eliminate other pests in addition to cockroaches.
### **Usage **
Normally, most cockroach pesticides are formulated for both indoors and outdoors. If your pesticides are targeted in areas that serve food, a lot of care should be taken not to poison the foot.
Where possible, buy pesticides whose ingredients are food-grade. Besides, follow the directions carefully.
### **Count**
Just as cockroach infestations come in different extents, so do pesticide quantities. The counts are other depending on the nature of the product.
Typically pesticides are available in tubes, liters, dozens, etc. So, depending on the extent of your roach infestation, you need to know how much you require.
For example, you may talk of 3 tubes of gel, two dozen bait traps, 5 liters of spray, etc.
### **Pets and kids Safe**
Kids and pets will be curious whenever they see something new in the house. Therefore cockroach killers can be very dangerous when not used properly.
Its however, advisable to buy roach killers that do not pose a lot of danger to kids and pets. Follow the directions of any pesticide carefully to ascertain the threats.
### **Dimensions **
When dealing with cockroach traps, the size of the trap matters a lot.ï¿½Small-sized traps are better because they dont look clumsy around the area or along walking paths. For gels and sprays, size does not matter.
## **Conclusion**
You dont have to live with cockroaches anymore! Its not the right time to call a professional exterminator, either. With the right kind of pesticide, you can say goodbye to roaches and other small pests in your house.
The products in this review are all best-selling remedies for cockroach infestation. Among these products, Bengal Gold Roach Spray turns out to be the best. Its handy and affordable.
