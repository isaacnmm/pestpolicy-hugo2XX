##  Details: 9 Home Remedies for Bed Bugs

###  1. Use Extreme Heat or Extreme Cold

One of the endless ways of killing bed bugs is by use of high or low temperature. Temperatures above 120 degrees Fahrenheit will destroy the entire infestation of bed bugs (eggs, larvae, and adults) in your home. To achieve this, you will need to carry out the following:

- Remove all the infested items with bed bugs/)and scatter them in one room to allow heat action on them. - Open all the closets in your house/room to enable heated airflow. - Lock all the windows, doors, and available ventilation to boost heating efficiency. - Remove all heat-sensitive items such as plastics and nylon clothes for special treatment (vacuuming).

- Place the room heating machines centrally to enhance equal distribution of heat within the room (uniform heat transfer. )

- You can put the indicator on window panes or doors to show a given color when[bed bugs killing](https://pestpolicy.com/does-baby-powder-kill-bed-bugs/)temperature(119 degrees Fahrenheit) reaches. - Switch on the machine and let it heat the room for 30 to 60 minutes, after which you will switch off. - Open the doors and window and let in fresh air for 30 minutes (helps in cooling the room) before cleaning the bedbug treated room and items.

All eggs and larva stage of bed bugs will begin to die at a temperature of 98 degrees Fahrenheit while adult bed bugs will start breaking at a temperature of 118 degrees Fahrenheit. It is essential to maintain the killing temperature anywhere between 120 to 140 (max) degrees Fahrenheit to allow the complete killing of bed bugs infestation. Alternatively, you can freeze the bed bug-infested items or room to a temperature below zero degrees.

The low temperature denatures enzymes' action in the bed bugs lifecycle, thus killing it. You will need to carry out freezing at least four days for complete bed bugs killing to take place. NB: *This method may be slightly expensive but very efficient and environmentally friendly (it cause no pollution). * Related: Pictures of bed Bugs

###  2. Vacuuming

In vacuuming, the vacuum machine sucks very tiny particles, including small insects (bed bugs). You will require a vacuum cleaner and a source of power/energy.

- Plug the vacuum cleaner into a power source and switch it on. - Run the machine for 1 to 3 minutes to enable it to reach the maximum working point. - Point the nozzle of the vacuum on the surface ofbed bugsinfested items. Make sure you leave ample space to allow effective sucking. - Ensure your vacuum walls, floor, cracks/crevices, and closets wherebed bugs can hide.

- After thoroughly vacuuming all the places, empty the vacuum cleaners trash bin into a furnace to burn all the sucked substances. Burning is the best way of ensuring all that has been sucked (includingbed bugs) is dead. The vacuuming kills bed bugs by sucking and whirling them at a higher velocity/speed. Those bed bugs that are not destroyed during sucking are secured at the trash bin, ready for destruction.

This method eliminated over 90% of bed bug infestation, including eggs and larvae.

Ensure you vacuum your bed bugs infested items thrice a month to remove bed bugs traces thoroughly.

###  3. Diatomaceous Earth

Diatomaceous Earth is naturally occurring sedimentary rocks that are formed from microorganisms that decomposed for many years. Your need to carry out the following:

- Grind the Diatomaceous Earth in fine grain powder. - Wear gloves and sprinkle the powder into bed bugs infested area. You canrub bedbug-infesteditems with Diatomaceous powder or sprinkle it over the items. - You can also fill cracks and crevices with this powder too. - Leave the treated area or items for 1 to 3 days. You will need to do this after every three weeks for complete bed bugs elimination.

- Then, vacuum the area or items to remove the Diatomaceous Earth and dead bed bugs.

Diatomaceous Earth kills bed bugs on contact. The sharp edges of the rock particles penetrate/easily pierce the exoskeleton/cuticle of the bed bugs, thus dehydrating them to death. The arsenic component found in the Diatomaceous Earth poisons the bed bugs when ingested (rare). This product is quick-acting and increases its working with the quantity applied.

Diatomaceous Earth is poisonous to your pets and children when swallowed though it does not cause irritation to your hands-on contact.

When purchasing Diatomaceous Earth, buy the one that is pest-related such as safe brand Diatomaceous Earth.

###  4. Using a Dryer (Hair and clothes)

A Dryer (for clothes) is a suitable device that can be used to kill bed bugs in bed bugs infested clothes and smaller items, which can fit in a given dryer.

- Select a dryer with a power rating that will generate a temperature above 110 degrees Fahrenheit (bed bug killingtemperature). - Plug the dyer into the power supply/socket. - Putbed bug-infesteditems into the dryer and close. - Switch on power. Set the dryer into a maximum temperature of 130 degrees Fahrenheit and a run time of 15 minutes. Then, press the dryer start button.

- Stop the dryer after 15 minutes if its not automatic and remove the items.

- Blow flesh air over the treated items to remove dead bed bugs or hung them for 2 to 3 hours. The Bed bugs in the infested items will die due to the high temperature on the dryer and swirling in the chamber. 99% of the live bed bugs, larvae, and eggs will be destroyed by this method. Its not advisable to put temperature-sensitive items in the dryer. Alternatively, you can use a hairdryer. - Plug the hairdryer into the power supply and switch on.

- Once heated, point the hot air from the dryer over the bed bugs infested items or areas. - I was once treated, leaver the items to cool before blowing cold air over them. The heat generated from the hairdryer kills the bed bugs on infested items on contact. This method can destroy 93% of the infestation (eggs, larvae, and adults).

The killing power of hair dryer or bed bug heaters is a function of the dryer's power rating (select a higher rated hairdryer to help generate high temperature).

###  5. Steam Cleaning

Steam cleaning involves the use of superheated steam from a steam generator to kill bed bugs infestation.

- Heat water in a steam generator to 117 degrees Fahrenheit (bed bugs killing temperature). - Direct the steam nozzle of the steam generator onto bedbug-infested items or areas. - Steam all closets, crevices/cracks, and floor. Take care since superheated steam may burn badly. - Leave the treated items to cool for 30 minutes before cleaning them. Superheated steam kill bed bug eggs, larvae, and adult bed bugs on contact.

This method is quick-acting though it may require a specialist for complete bed bugs elimination. Keep off all heat sensitive items and pets during treatment.

###  6. Using Borax (Boric acid)

Borax, also called boric acid, is a home solution that can instantly kill bed bugs on application. The borax concentration determines the ability to kill bed bugsand the amount fed/breathed by a bed bug.

- Wear hand protection (gloves) and sprinkle borax on bed bugs infested items (mattress, bed sheet, clothes, etc. ) or area (cracks, floor, or closets). - Leave them for 20 to 50 hours for the chemical to work. - After treatment, clean the items to remove borax and dead bed bugs. Box kills bed bugs by suffocating them. Though [bed bugs wont eat](https://pestpolicy.com/what-animals-eat-bed-bugs/)box as per se, the environment will make bed bugs difficult to breathe, thus dying.

This method will kill up to 95% of adult bed bugs. This method wont kill eggs. Therefore, you need to combine it with a complement method such as steam treatment. Borax will cause a burning sensation when in contact with eyes and upset your stomach when swallowed and should be kept away from children.

###  7. Using Vinegar

Vinegar is a robust bed bug killer since it contains a strong acetic acid, which affects the bed bugs' nervous system.

- Measure 100ml of vinegar (Kroger Brand Heinz Distilled or Walmart) and mix with an equal amount of water. - Put the mixture in a spray bottle and spray over the bed bugs infested items or area (cracks, floor, or closets). - Leave the area for 30 minutes for the medicine to act/kill. - Clean the items after treatment to remove vinegar and dead bed bugs. Vinegar will kill adult bed bugs on contact.

The acetic acid in the vinegar will attack the nervous system, thus inhibiting transport activities. Most of the bed bugs larvae wont die on contact (especially if the concentration wont be much). Therefore, it is recommended to supplement this method with others, such as the use of Diatomaceous Earth. It would help if you did not use vinegar on acid-sensitive items.

###  8. Rubbing Alcohol

Alcohol is able to kill the entire life-cycle of bed bugs (eggs, larvae, and adults) on contact. - Put concentrated alcohol in a spray bottle. - Spray over the bed bugs infested items (beddings, clothes, couch) and areas (crevices/cracks, walls, floor, and closets). - Leave the area for 4 to 6 hours for the chemical to work. All the bed bugs that come into contact with alcohol will be killed.

Wear a breathing mask (irritates nasal cavity on inhaling) and hand protection when spraying.

###  9. Baking Soda

To kill bed bugs using baking powder, carry out the following steps. The baking powder kills bed bugs on contacts. It will dehydrate the exoskeleton/cuticle of bed bugs, thus killing them.

- Sprinkle baking powder over the bed bugs infested areas (floor, wall, cracks/crevices, and closets) and items (clothes, couches, beddings, or mattresses). - Leave the items for 2 to 6 hours. - Clean the treated items/area to remove baking powder and dead bed bugs. This method will kill up to 97% of bed bugs infestation.

Though some eggs may be destroyed, it is advisable to supplement this method with other ways, such as steam or Diatomaceous Earth.

###  10. Use of Bed Bug Herbals: Indiana Lilac Leaves

Bed bug herbals entail plant and plant extracts that keep away or kill bed bugs in your place. Indiana Lilac or lavender emit a scent that either poison the bed bugs or keep them off. To achieve this, you can carry out the following procedure: - Crush the Indiana Lilac lives into fine particles. - Spread the crushed leaves in bed bugs infested area and items. - Alternatively, boil the Indian Lilac leaves and strain the solution.
