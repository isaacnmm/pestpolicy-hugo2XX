## My Take on LeafFilter Vs. LeafGuard
At a glance, both LeafFilter and LeafGuard aim for the same goal: clog
- free gutters. However, their approaches are quite different.
**LeafFilter** is a **micro
- mesh gutter guard** system that installs *over your existing gutters*. It features a surgical
- grade stainless steel mesh (275 microns, one of the finest available) over a rigid uPVC frame, designed to block even the tiniest debris like shingle grit, pine needles, and pollen, while allowing water to flow through. Its strength lies in its superior filtration.
**LeafGuard** is a **one
- piece, seamless gutter and gutter guard system**. This means your old gutters are removed, and a brand new, custom
- fit aluminum gutter with an integrated, reverse
- curve hood is installed. Water flows over the curved hood and into a narrow opening via surface tension, while leaves and larger debris are shed over the edge. Its strength is in being a complete, seamless replacement solution.
**My quick take:** * **Choose LeafFilter if:** Your existing gutters are in good condition, and your primary concern is blocking **all types of debris**, especially fine particles like pine needles and shingle grit. It's generally less visually intrusive and can be a slightly more affordable professional option. * **Choose LeafGuard if:** Your existing gutters are old, damaged, or need replacing anyway.
You deal primarily with **large debris** like leaves and twigs, and you desire a seamless, all
- in
- one system with maximum water flow for heavy downpours.

## LeafFilter Vs. LeafGuard Warranties
Warranties are a major selling point for both companies, but they differ in what they cover:
* **LeafFilter Warranty:** Offers a **lifetime transferable warranty** with a **"no
- clog" guarantee**. This means if your gutters ever clog while LeafFilter is installed, or if your home experiences interior water damage due to a clog, the company pledges to fix the issue or refund your material purchase price. This warranty is fully transferable to subsequent homeowners, adding value to your property.
* **LeafGuard Warranty:** Provides a **lifetime warranty** that covers blistering, flaking, chipping, cracking, peeling, splitting, rotting, structural deterioration, and will clean your gutters for free if they clog. While it includes a clog
- free promise, some reports suggest it's more focused on the product's finish and structural integrity than a strict "no
- clog" refund. The transferability of the warranty might be for a limited period (e.g., 50 years) rather than the lifetime of the home.
**Key takeaway on warranties:** LeafFilter's warranty is generally seen as more explicit and comprehensive regarding its "no
- clog" guarantee and full transferability. LeafGuard's warranty is strong for the entire gutter system, but specific clog
- free guarantees might vary. Always read the fine print of any warranty before signing a contract.

## Installation Services of LeafFilter Vs LeafGuard
The installation process is a major differentiator between the two systems:
* **LeafFilter Installation:** * **Process:** LeafFilter installs over your existing gutters. Technicians will first thoroughly clean, seal, and realign your gutters if needed. Then, the micro
- mesh system (uPVC frame with stainless steel mesh) is carefully fitted and secured to the fascia board, ensuring a slight slope for water and debris shedding. * **Impact on Roof/Gutters:** It does not require screwing into your roof shingles, preserving roof warranties.
It only impacts your existing gutters minimally with attachments to the fascia or gutter lip. * **Timeline:** Installation is typically completed in a single day for most homes.
* **LeafGuard Installation:** * **Process:** LeafGuard is a complete gutter replacement. Old gutters are removed and often recycled. On
- site, custom
- made seamless aluminum gutters with the integrated reverse
- curve guard are fabricated to the exact dimensions of your home. These new gutters are then securely attached to your fascia with hidden hangers. * **Impact on Roof/Gutters:** Since it replaces your entire gutter system, it's ideal if your old gutters are damaged or outdated.
It's designed to install without disturbing the roof shingles. * **Timeline:** Installation is usually completed in a single day, depending on the home's size and complexity.
**Key takeaway on installation:** LeafFilter is less invasive if your gutters are perfectly fine. LeafGuard is more comprehensive and ideal if you need a full gutter system overhaul. Both are professionally installed, ensuring proper fitting and functionality.

## FAQs About LeafFilter and LeafGuard
**Q: Which one is better for pine needles?** A: **LeafFilter** is generally superior for pine needles due to its ultra
- fine micro
- mesh, which effectively blocks even the smallest needles. LeafGuard's reverse
- curve design can sometimes allow pine needles to slip into the narrow opening.
**Q: Can LeafGuard or LeafFilter prevent ice dams?** A: No gutter guard, including LeafFilter or LeafGuard, can fully prevent ice dams from forming on your roof. Ice dams are primarily caused by heat loss from your attic melting snow on the roof, which then refreezes at the colder eaves and gutters. While keeping gutters clear helps drainage, it doesn't address the root cause of ice dam formation.
**Q: Do either of these systems require maintenance?** A: Both systems are designed to be "maintenance
- free" in terms of interior gutter cleaning. However, no gutter guard is truly "no maintenance." Both may require occasional rinsing of the surface to clear pollen, shingle grit, or sticky residue that can accumulate, especially on LeafFilter's mesh or within LeafGuard's opening.
**Q: Will installing these guards void my roof warranty?** A: Both LeafFilter and LeafGuard are designed to be installed without penetrating or interfering with your roof shingles, thus preserving most roof warranties. Always confirm with your roofing manufacturer if you have concerns, but this is a standard design consideration for reputable gutter guard companies.
**Q: Are there any downsides to LeafFilter?** A: The main downsides are its higher cost compared to basic guards, some customer complaints about aggressive sales tactics, and occasional reports of pollen or sap buildup on the mesh requiring light cleaning, or overshooting in extreme, localized downpours on specific roof sections.
**Q: What are the downsides of LeafGuard?** A: Downsides include its higher upfront cost (as it includes new gutters), potential for smaller debris like pine needles or shingle grit to enter the gutter, and possible overshooting in very heavy rainfall, especially on steep roof pitches where water can sheet over the curve.

When it comes to top
- tier, professionally installed gutter protection systems, [LeafFilter](https://pestpolicy.com/leaf
- filter
- reviews/)and [LeafGuard](https://pestpolicy.com/leafguard/)are two of the most recognized names in the industry. Both promise to eliminate gutter cleaning and protect your home from water damage, but they achieve this through fundamentally different designs and offer distinct advantages.

Choosing between them often comes down to your home's specific needs, existing gutter condition, and budget.

This article provides a detailed, head

##  Cost of LeafFilter Vs. LeafGuard

Both LeafFilter and LeafGuard are premium, professionally installed gutter protection systems, meaning their costs are significantly higher than DIY options. Exact pricing is not available online as it's determined after an in
- home assessment, but here are general estimates:

* **LeafFilter Cost: ** Typically ranges from **$15 to $45+ per linear foot**, including materials and professional installation. For an average home (150
- 200 linear feet), total costs can range from **$2, 250 to $9, 000 or more**. Factors like home height, roof complexity, and current gutter condition (cleaning/minor repairs are usually included) influence the price.

* **LeafGuard Cost: ** Often ranges from **$16 to $45+ per linear foot**, making it comparable to, or slightly higher than, LeafFilter. However, it's crucial to remember that LeafGuard includes a **complete replacement of your existing gutters** with their seamless system. For an average home, total costs can be anywhere from **$2, 400 to $9, 000 or higher**.

If you need new gutters anyway, LeafGuard's all
- in
- one solution might offer better value.

**Key takeaway on cost: ** While their per
- linear
- foot costs can seem similar, the crucial distinction is that LeafGuard includes new gutters, whereas LeafFilter installs on your existing ones. If your gutters are old, LeafGuard might be more cost
- effective than buying new gutters *and* then installing LeafFilter. Both companies often offer financing options and seasonal discounts, so always get a free, in
- home estimate.

- Obligation Quotes: ** Both companies provide free in
- home consultations and detailed estimates. This is standard practice in the gutter guard industry. * **Seasonal Discounts: ** Look out for seasonal sales or limited
- time promotions, especially during off
- peak seasons.

##  LeafFilter Vs. LeafGuard Reviews

Customer reviews offer valuable insights into real
- world performance and customer service. Both companies have a significant presence online with mixed reviews, as is common with large national companies.

* **LeafFilter Reviews: ** * **Positives: ** Many customers praise its effectiveness at blocking even the smallest debris (pine needles, shingle grit), excellent water flow in heavy rain, and the peace of mind offered by the "no
- clog" warranty. Satisfied customers often highlight responsive sales and installation teams.

* **Negatives: ** Common complaints include high pricing, perceived aggressive sales tactics, and occasional reports of overflow in extreme downpours (especially at roof valleys), or debris accumulating on the mesh surface requiring occasional rinsing. Some also mention ice dam formation in cold climates, which can be an issue for any gutter guard.

* **LeafGuard Reviews: ** * **Positives: ** Customers appreciate the seamless, one
- piece design and its ability to shed large leaves effectively. The system's durability and the aesthetic appeal of new gutters are also frequently mentioned. Many find it truly low
- maintenance for large debris. * **Negatives: ** A recurring issue is that the narrow opening can sometimes allow smaller debris (pine needles, shingle grit) to enter and cause clogs.

Overflow can occur on very steep roofs or during torrential downpours where water "sheets" over the curve rather than adhering. Some customers also report high pricing.

**Key takeaway on reviews: ** LeafFilter generally has higher customer satisfaction ratings regarding debris protection, especially for fine particles. LeafGuard is lauded for its seamless design and effectiveness against large leaves but struggles more with fine debris. Both companies sometimes face criticism regarding sales pressure and pricing.

##  Is LeafFilter or LeafGuard the Best?

There's no single "best" answer; the ideal choice depends on your specific circumstances:

* **Choose LeafFilter if: ** * Your existing gutters are in good condition and don't need replacement. * You are primarily dealing with a wide variety of debris, including fine particles like pine needles, shingle grit, and seeds. * You want the most robust "no
- clog" guarantee and lifetime transferability. * You prefer a less visible gutter guard installed on top of your current system.

* **Choose LeafGuard if: ** * Your existing gutters are old, damaged, or you were planning to replace them anyway. * You primarily experience large leaf and twig debris. * You prefer a completely new, seamless gutter system with an integrated guard. * You value a durable, one
- piece aluminum system that is custom
- fabricated on
- site.

Both are premium investments that offer significant protection and reduce gutter maintenance. It's highly recommended to get free quotes from both companies, discuss your specific needs, and compare the detailed proposals, including warranties and any discounts.
