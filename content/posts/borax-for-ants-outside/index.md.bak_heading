- Borax is a popular and effective solution for controlling ants, especially outdoors. It disrupts the ants digestive system, ultimately eliminating them and their colonies. Heres a guide on how to use borax effectively to deal with ants in your yard or garden.

##  How to Use Borax for Ants Outside

###  1. Understand How Borax Works

Borax, a naturally occurring mineral, is toxic to ants but safe for humans and pets when used correctly. Ants are attracted to borax
- based bait, which they carry back to their colony, effectively poisoning the queen and other members over time.

- Add enough water to create a thick paste.
- Place the mixture on small pieces of cardboard or in shallow containers near ant trails.

###  3. Place the Bait Strategically

Locate ant trails or areas with heavy ant activity outside. Place the borax bait along these paths, near anthills, or around the perimeter of your garden. Ensure the bait is out of reach of pets and small children.

###  4. Monitor and Replenish

Check the bait regularly to ensure it hasnt dried out or been consumed entirely. Replenish as needed until you notice a significant reduction in ant activity. This process may take a few days to a week for full colony elimination.

###  5. Use Borax in a Spray Solution

If youre dealing with a widespread infestation, a borax spray can help target larger areas. Mix 1 tablespoon of borax with 1 cup of warm water and a few drops of dish soap. Pour the solution into a spray bottle and apply it directly to anthills, nests, or trails.

###  Safety Precautions

While borax is generally safe, follow these precautions:
- Keep borax and bait away from food preparation areas and water sources.
- Avoid applying borax directly to edible plants or crops.
- Wear gloves when handling borax to prevent skin irritation.
- Store borax in a secure place, away from children and pets.
