So, what are the Rules for better box jumps?

###  1. Practice Landing

The correct landing will help you avoid stress on joints or the lower back. If this is your first time doing box jumps, dont let fear hold you back. You need to build on your confidence by doing progression exercises.

First, you can step onto the box then step down. Continue doing this process until you feel comfortable enough with the movements.

Next, incorporate your arms; let them swing freely as you step up the box. Youll notice that your coordination has improved and youre ready for your first jump.

###  2. Develop Correct Squatting Posture

If you do squats correctly and youre comfortable doing them, then youre highly likely to perform well in box jumps.

However, if you are not good at squats you can practice. Check your form while squatting. Ensure your hips and knees are bends and your weight is in your heels. Chest out, then squat.

While doing box jumps avoid dropping into deep squat positions. Deep squatting may make jumping difficult. Instead, drop into a snap position before jumping. Hips should be above the knees. Knees should remain stable and apart.

###  3. Start With a Low Box Height

Start with a low-height box before advancing to the higher ones. Master the art of effective jumping first to avoid getting injuries.

Dont feel intimidated when you see others exercising on a 50-inch box or a height higher than the one youre currently using. Everyone has his or her own fitness journey, as you must start somewhere.

###  **4. Best box jump height for beginners**

6 inches box height is ideal for a beginner box jumper. If you feel strong you can go a bit higher and start at 12 inches.
