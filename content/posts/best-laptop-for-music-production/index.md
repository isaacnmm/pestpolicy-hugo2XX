*But, is MacBook Air good for music production? Yes, MacBook Air use an Intel i7 2. 2GHz dual-core processor, and its thus a powerful laptop in the music production and live music tasks due to its fast speed. You can boost the i7 up to 3. 2GHz to boost performance. * - ***As a second choice in studio recording, audio-processing & mixing tasks, I recommend the Apple 15 inch MacBook Pro as the best laptop for music production. ***

It has overheating issues - since everyone is demanding more processing power and a very thin laptop. It has fewer USB ports - thus, you'll want a dongle or USB-C hubs. * *MagSafe is gone - take care on stage.
