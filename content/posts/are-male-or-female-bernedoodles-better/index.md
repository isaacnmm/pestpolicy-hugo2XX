## **Feeding Schedule**
A feeding schedule is necessary to avoid health problems. Obesity among dogs is a common issue as owners typically do not follow a diet plan.
- Bernedoodle puppies are more physically active, which makes feeding them less of an issue. As they grow up, they tend to get slower and proportionally gain more weight.
