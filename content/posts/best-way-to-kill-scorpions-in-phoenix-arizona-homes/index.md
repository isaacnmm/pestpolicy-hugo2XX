For homeowners in Phoenix, scorpions are a fact of life. The primary threat, the Arizona Bark Scorpion, is venomous, can climb walls, and can squeeze through a gap as thin as a credit card. Simply seeing one is not the problem; it's a symptom of a larger issue.

Let's be direct: there is no magic "repellent." **The single best way to kill scorpions and protect your home is a disciplined application of a professional-grade residual insecticide, combined with a systematic elimination of their food, water, and shelter.** This is not about spot-spraying the one you see; it's about creating a lethal barrier and making your property an inhospitable wasteland for scorpions and the pests they feed on.

### The "Why": Why Your Home is a Scorpion Magnet

Scorpions are in and around your home for three reasons:

1.  **Food:** They feed on crickets, cockroaches, spiders, and other common desert insects. If you have these pests, you will have scorpions.
2.  **Water:** Your home's irrigation, pool, and AC condensation lines provide the consistent moisture they need to survive the brutal heat.
3.  **Shelter (Harborage):** They are nocturnal and must hide from the sun during the day. Cinder block walls, piles of rocks or firewood, and dense vegetation are all five-star scorpion hotels.

### The Field-Tested Elimination Plan

This is a comprehensive, professional-grade approach.

#### Phase 1: The Chemical Barrier (Your Primary Weapon)

This is the most critical step for actively killing scorpions.

1.  **Choose the Right Product:** You need a modern, micro-encapsulated insecticide concentrate. Products with active ingredients like **Cy-Kick CS (Cyfluthrin)** or **Onslaught FastCap (multiple)** are the professional standard. These formulas are designed to withstand the high UV exposure in Arizona and provide a long-lasting residual effect.
2.  **The Application is Everything:** Using a 1- or 2-gallon pump sprayer, you must treat the key areas where scorpions hunt, hide, and enter.
    *   **The Foundation Barrier:** Spray a continuous 2-3 foot wide band on the ground around the entire perimeter of your foundation, and 2-3 feet up the exterior walls.
    *   **Entry Points:** Thoroughly treat around all doors, windows, and where utility lines enter the house.
    *   **Harborage Areas:** Spray into the gaps and cracks of cinder block walls, at the base of pillars, and around any water sources like AC units and hose bibs.
3.  **Timing and Safety:** Apply the treatment in the early evening when scorpions begin to become active. Keep children and pets off the treated area until it is completely dry. Always read and follow the product label exactly.

#### Phase 2: Eliminate Their Food and Shelter

A chemical barrier is only as good as the environment it's in. You must make your yard less attractive.

*   **Kill Their Food Source:** The same insecticide application will also kill the crickets, roaches, and other pests that scorpions prey on.
*   **Eliminate Harborage:** This is non-negotiable. Clean up all piles of rocks, wood, and debris. Trim back overgrown bushes and thin out dense ground cover.
*   **Seal the Home:** Use caulk and weather stripping to seal every possible crack on the exterior of your home. Pay special attention to the gap under doors and the areas around pipes.

#### Phase 3: The Night Hunt (For Immediate Reduction)

*   **Get a Blacklight:** After your chemical barrier has dried, use a high-quality UV (blacklight) flashlight at night to patrol your yard. Scorpions will glow a brilliant fluorescent green, making them incredibly easy to spot.
*   **The Takedown:** You can then kill them individually (a brick or a boot works well) or with a contact spray. This provides immediate population reduction while the residual insecticide barrier does its long-term work.

### FAQ

**Q: What about Diatomaceous Earth or other "natural" products?**
A: Diatomaceous earth can kill scorpions, but it is a slow-acting dehydrating agent. In the harsh, dry climate of Phoenix, it can be a useful supplemental tool when applied as a dust to wall voids and other hidden areas. However, it is not effective enough on its own to create the fast-acting, reliable protective barrier needed to stop Arizona Bark Scorpions.

**Q: I was stung. What should I do?**
A: The sting of an Arizona Bark Scorpion is extremely painful and medically significant, especially for children, the elderly, and those with allergies. Wash the area with soap and water, apply a cool compress, and immediately call the Banner Poison and Drug Information Center at (800) 222-1222. They are the experts and will advise you on the necessary steps.

**Q: Why do I see more scorpions inside after a professional treatment?**
A: This is actually a common and often positive sign. The insecticide irritates the scorpions and drives them out of their hiding places (like wall voids), forcing them into the open where they will come into contact with a lethal dose of the product and die. It means the treatment is reaching them.
