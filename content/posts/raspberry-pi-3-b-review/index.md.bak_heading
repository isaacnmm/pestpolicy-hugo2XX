##  Raspberry Pi 3 B Review + Performance

###  Hardware

Pi 3 Model 3 B+ has two key features that stand out compared to earlier Pi models: a metal shield that covers the Bluetooth and WiFi circuitry (assist in RF emissions containment) and the SoC's metal cover (for dissipating heat). *But, what are the favorable hardware modifications? *
- Model 3 B+comes with a push or pull MicroSD card slot as opposed to the earlier push
- to
- eject.
- It comes with a premium
- looking Pi logo that is engaged on its wireless cover.

Previous models had the symbol being etched on their circuit board, which looked low
- class. Further, the Broadcom SoC has a beautiful metal cover.
- Model 3 B+ has a metal enclosure CPU build that dissipates heat well than the plastic covering on the earlier models: without additional active cooling or heatsink.
- Further, it has a highly standardized board layout and forms factor The critical hardware improvements that could do in the future include:
- Improve the I/O, such as incorporating USB 3. 0. ports in place of the current USB 2. 0. Read Also: Power Supply for Raspberry Pi 3

###  Networking

On
- board LAN was a critical aspect of the Raspberry Pi Model 3 that required a significant overhaul. The model 3 B+ now has the 10/100/1000 Gigabit LAN controller as opposed to just the 10/100 controller. Therefore, the in
- build port will not be capped at 100 Mbps (practically ~93 Mbps). Model 3 B+ will thus give you more bandwidth, and you won't need gigabyte networking like before.

Due to the improved Raspbian OS and the Pi 3 B+'s better power, the initial impression with the B+ is excellent.

The test results showed an improvement in the processing power, such as fast USB data transfer and better benchmarks performance. Its CPU has a heat spreader at its top, and thus the processor won't throttle its performance. However, the wireless and wired benchmark test showed no significant difference from the previous Pi 3 that has inferior features.

###  **Exposed Circuits design**

My first impression of the Raspberry Pi 3B+ is an excellent
- looking circuit board that measures 0. 63*3. 5*2. 2 in.
- Notably, all the components are visible: 40
- pin GPIO input/output connector and the 1. 4GHz ARM processor. Also, the board includes a micro
- SD slot, 3. 5 mm audio output, HDMI, Ethernet, four USB 2. 0, and a micro
- USB connector.

- new Model B+ has a 64
- bit processor and in
- built wireless connectivity.
- Despite not having not many additional features, the Model B+ has some unique tasks that will be completed much more comfortably.
- For example, with the processor upgrade that allows faster speeds, it'll be easier to complete tasks that require enormous computing power, such as creating a home
- theatre PC. Further, despite having the same 1GB memory, the Model B+ comes with a 200MHz faster CPU. On the negative side, however, Pi 3 Model B+ could not effectively play the YouTube 1080p video.

However, you may install VLC through different apps or command lines to play SDcard
- loaded HD video.

PROS
- Superior networking and faster processor
- Highly customizable and easy to install CONS
- Ethernet port won't attain the 1Gbps top speed described. I used benchmarks from the browser to assess the significance of the 200MHz CPU speed increase.
- First, I used the JavaScript Sunspider 1. 0. 2, and it took 1. 92 seconds. Notably, the above is double the speed of the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B that takes 2. 77 secs.

###  **Requires some Add
- Ons**

If you are utilizing the Raspberry Pi in complex projects, you must add components such as a Pi case, fans, and heat sinks.
- To create an excellent first computer, you'll need a case that has top ports' cut
- outs, and that will be easy to dismantle whenever required.
- Also, you can include a PoE hat adapter to power up the Raspberry Pi through the Ethernet cable
- supplied power, mainly when used with motion detectors.

Model B+'s Ethernet port will allow the gigabit transfer speeds with speeds going up to 315Mbps. Your WiFi radio will do superior in Model B+'s 5GHz band.
