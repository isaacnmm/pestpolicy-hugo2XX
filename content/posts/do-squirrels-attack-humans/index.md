Summertime in many parts of the World including the United States such as in Washington, D. C. , largely experiences an upsurge of squirrels - [they live longer too](https://pestpolicy.com/how-long-do-squirrels-live/).Well, squirrels are comparatively cute and most of us may get attracted to them. In fact, we argue that squirrels are not like lions, bears, or wolves. But do squirrels attack humans?

*In brief, Yes, squirrels will attack humans whenever they feel threatened - their powerful bites may bring dangerous diseases. So, if you love watching or feeding squirrels in the backyard, you must keep some safe distance. * - Therefore, if there are squirrels around your house or backyard, you'll need to hire professional [squirrel](https://pestpolicy.com/do-squirrels-carry-ticks/)control - these will help with inspection and control of the squirrel.

##  Details: Do Squirrels Attack Humans?

Despite being cute animals, squirrels are equally territorial and competitive mammals. Therefore, the males and females will compete for territories while building nests during fall. Further, in winter, the squirrel's food is scarce and thus the animals must hide this resource from their rival squirrels. Therefore, the competition causes increased aggressiveness.

- Thus, during such times squirrels will also attack humans since they can't stand having their babies or food being taken away from them. Any human who gets near such as an aggressive squirrel may appear like a threat to these wild animals and thus it'll launch its self-defense for survival. - Therefore, I advise getting to some safe distance from the squirrels since they may seriously harm you or your pets.

Notably, squirrels have strong and sharp teeth that'll chew through soft metal, plastic, and wood. So, a bite on the human body may leave the person needing some stitches.

##  Risk of Infection from Squirrel Bites?

Squirrels have dirty claws as they use them largely for many of their daily hunting or attacking activities. - Injuries on humans caused by squirrel claws may bring diseases such as Plague, Salmonellosis, Tularemia, and Leptospirosis - these spread largely via feces and saliva.

Further, squirrels may also carry parasites such as fleas and ticks - but you may use flea spray for the backyard - and these may cause diseases such as Encephalitis and Lyme disease.

- Squirrels will not just attack humans while in the open yards, but may also follow you to the house or also give you a run in the attic as they seek nesting places. For the attic, the squirrels will get into that space by clawing or chewing through roof gaps, chimneys, plumbing vents, and roof vents. - The animals will nest inside the attic around the insulation - where they destroy it or smear it with its body waste.

Such damage in damage by the squirrels will expose your roof to different environmental elements while also increasing your energy costs. - Besides, the squirrels will chew house elements like the electrical wires while also causing an attraction to pests like raccoons.

##  **What Should We Do When a Squirrel Gets Inside?**

If a squirrel lands on your property, especially in the attic, you must take quick remedies to avoid further attacks on humans and pets. I recommend you; - Use vinegar: Soak some rags into cider vinegar and place these around the door of the attic or at your fireplace. - Make noise: When the squirrel is already in the chimney or attic, make massive noises to help scare the animal away from your property.

Further, for any squirrel that is threatening to attack humans or is inside your property - consider hiring some professional remover and don't get overly close to the animals to avoid injury. - The pest control and removal experts will definitely understand the behavior of squirrels as compared to most of us. - Thus, the experts will remove the animals without hurting anyone.

##  Why Keep Squirrels Off Your Humans and Our Homes?

Wild animals including squirrels can sometimes be unpredictable. The animals will become overly aggressive and attack humans if they feel threatened. More squirrels in the backyard increase the likelihood of some of them chewing their way to your house, chimney, or also in the houses' attic. - Further, squirrels may drop their wet or dry body waste in the yard or in the house - these may pose a hazard to the pets and humans too.

As noted above, the squirrels may eat through electrical wires and hence may lead to a power outage, fires, and economic losses around the house. Chewing or gnawing on plumbing works and pipes by the squirrels may lead to breakages and water leakages in the house or the backyard. - Squirrels will come from the wild environment and will thus carry bugs and parasites such as mites, ticks, and fleas -humans may get ear mites from dogs?

##  How to RemoveSquirrels

So, if you're not ready to allow the squirrels to leave your surrounding on their own or if they're attacking humans, then you need to adopt appropriate removal methods. - A one-way squirrels exclusion door will work well in removing the animals since once they get out of the home or yard, they won't easily get back and attack humans.

- [Live-trapping of these squirrels](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-squirrels-in-the-yard/)willhelp easily and humanely remove these animals from our spaces. For example, one may use cage traps in spaces such as holes and attics. - Further, after you've trapped or caught the animals from the attic, you'll require to seal all the entry points that the squirrels used to access the spaces.

- Despite that some DIY squirrel-control chemicals exist in the stotes, experts do not recommend these remedies as they may be dangerous to people and pets, especially when applied carelessly or incorrectly.
