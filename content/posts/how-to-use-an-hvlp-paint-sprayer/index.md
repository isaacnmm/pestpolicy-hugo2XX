###  Step 3: Fix the Right Hosepipe and Power Cable length

According to the surface area under paint application, you may need to extend the suction hosepipe (to offer wide-area coverage) and the power cable to prevent frequent removal or disconnection. Further, the extension hosepipe should be the same size as the feed pipe to prevent internal shocks when painting due to pressure differences. Avoid using low-grade extension power cable they cause internal cut-off in case of a power surge.

###  Step 4: Fasten the HVLP canister in Place and Other Gun Connections

Fasten the HVLP canister appropriately you can screw or slide to lock depending on the nature of the lock mechanism. Moreover, fit other gun connections properly and alight the spray gun channel to pick paint flow effectively and improve the atomization process.

###  Step 5: Plugin the HVLP Paint Sprayer to Power Supply

Connect the extension cable with the sprayers power plug pin (consider a qualified electrician during the connection) and plug it into a power source. Switch on the power button at the source. NB: The power cable should be placed alongside to prevent crisscross danger when painting.

###  Step 6: Set the Paint sprayers Air pressure and Volume Accordingly

During paint application, try to maintain a continuous even distance over the surface (between spray gun and surface) and avoid excessive trigger action as it leads to overspray or uneven paint coating. Besides, instant trigger disconnection between points is highly recommended to prevent surface drains or runs.

###  Step 10: Release the Trigger and end Spraying

Once you finish painting, release the gun trigger at the endpoint spray technique. Alternatively, you run the test board over the paint surface during paint application for instant cut off before you release the trigger. Wrong trigger termination initiates drains and forms an uneven surface coat layer.

###  Step 11: Power off and Reset the Pressure

Switch off the sprayer (at the gun provision) and reset the pressure dial just turn the control know to the lowest point. For a digital set up, key the setting to zero standards. Proceed and power off the entire connection at the main power source. Then, unplug the cable and disconnect the power cord from the sprayer.
