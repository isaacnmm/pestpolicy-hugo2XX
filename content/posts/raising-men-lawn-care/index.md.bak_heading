- profit organization founded by Rodney Smith Jr. in Huntsville, Alabama.

Far from being a conventional commercial lawn care business, RMLCS operates with a profound humanitarian and educational mission: to empower and inspire children and young adults across the globe to engage in community service by providing free lawn care for those in need. It's a movement that transcends grass cutting, fostering values of kindness, responsibility, and empathy in the next generation.

Rodney Smith Jr. , the visionary behind RMLCS, was inspired to start the initiative after seeing an elderly man struggling to mow his lawn. This simple observation ignited a powerful idea: what if he could mobilize young people to help those who couldn't help themselves, while simultaneously teaching them valuable life lessons?

What began with Rodney mowing 50 lawns for free quickly evolved into a national and then international phenomenon, touching countless lives and sparking a wave of generosity. The core philosophy of RMLCS is not just about transforming neglected lawns; it's about transforming lives through acts of service and teaching young people the profound joy and satisfaction that comes from giving back.
