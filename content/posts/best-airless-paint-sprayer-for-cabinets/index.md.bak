##  Sanding the Cabinets Prior to Painting

After cleaning the cabinet, you'll require to sand these pieces of furniture. So, sand the cabinets lightly to remove any primer sticks you'll find. You'll use sandpaper that's a maximum of 150-grit when there's no paint or sand. However, for cabinets with varnish, sand using sandpaper that's 80-grit. The sanding process will remove any imperfections, gouges, dings, scratches, or flaws that may affect the paint p[roject's finish on the cabinet.

However, for deeper implications, you'll need to use some cabinet wood filler that'll also cover any wood grains. Finally, clean the surface using some wet lint-free fabric.

##  Priming your Kitchen Cabinets

Priming your kitchen cabinets will help produce superior bonds between the primer and the paint for smoother finishes and very durable colors. Check the bonding primer for cabinets. You must start the beginning applying from the top while working your way down. You can use a roller or small brush to allow the surfaces of the cabinet to end up being smooth.

Further, consider primer matching since, for example, oil-based paints won't mix with a latex primer.

Primers will protect the cabinet surfaces from steam or humidity.

##  Conclusion

On the number of coating, I consider 2 coats of primer to be appropriate - as you check the best airless paint sprayer for cabinets and home furniture.
