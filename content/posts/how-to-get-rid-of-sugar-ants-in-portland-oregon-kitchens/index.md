For homeowners in Portland, the sight of a thin, black line of tiny ants marching across a kitchen counter is a frustratingly common experience, especially during the spring and summer. These are Odorous House Ants, often called "sugar ants," and our damp Pacific Northwest climate creates the ideal conditions for them to thrive.

The key to eliminating them is to resist the urge to grab a can of bug spray. **The only effective way to get rid of sugar ants is to use a slow-acting ant bait to destroy the entire hidden colony.** Spraying only kills the foraging workers you see, while the queen and thousands of other ants remain safe in the nest, ready to send out a new team tomorrow. This guide provides the professional baiting strategy that works with the ants' biology to solve the problem for good.

### The "Why": Why Sugar Ants Love Portland Homes

The Odorous House Ant is the number one nuisance pest in our region for a few key reasons:

*   **Moisture:** Our famously damp weather, from the rainy winters to the wet springs, creates the moist soil conditions these ants love. They often build their shallow nests right up against your home's foundation, under rocks, or in piles of mulch.
*   **Rotting Wood:** The same moisture can lead to small pockets of damp or rotting wood in older homes, especially around window frames and under sinks. This is a perfect place for them to establish an indoor satellite nest.
*   **Abundant Food:** A typical kitchen provides a constant supply of the sugary and greasy foods they crave. A few crumbs, a sticky spot on the counter, or an un-rinsed dish is a feast for a foraging ant.

### The Field-Tested Elimination Plan

This is a three-part strategy: bait the ants you see, clean their trails, and seal their entry points.

#### Phase 1: The Baiting Strategy (Your Primary Weapon)

1.  **Use the Right Bait:** You need a high-quality liquid or gel ant bait. These baits are a mix of a food attractant and a slow-acting insecticide. Terro Liquid Ant Baits are a widely available and highly effective option that uses borax as the active ingredient.
2.  **Placement is Everything:** Do not place the bait in the middle of your counter. You must place the bait stations or apply the gel bait directly on the ant trail itself. The goal is to make it as easy as possible for the ants to find the bait and start carrying it back to the nest.
3.  **Do Not Kill the Ants:** This is the most important and difficult rule for homeowners to follow. You will see a large number of ants swarming the bait. **You must leave them alone.** Let them eat the bait and transport it back to the nest to feed the queen and other workers. This process can take several days to a week.

#### Phase 2: The Clean-Up

*   **Wipe Up Trails (Everywhere Else):** While you let the ants feed on the bait, you can clean up other trails to prevent new ants from finding other food sources. Use a 50/50 solution of white vinegar and water to wipe down your counters and floors. This erases the invisible pheromone trail that ants use for navigation.
*   **Remove Food Sources:** Be extra vigilant about cleaning. Wipe up any spills immediately, store sugary foods like honey and syrup in the refrigerator, and don't leave pet food out.

#### Phase 3: The Exclusion (Long-Term Prevention)

Once the ant activity has stopped, the final step is to block their entry points.

*   **Inspect and Seal:** Check along your baseboards, window frames, and under the kitchen sink. Look for the tiny cracks and gaps the ants were using to get in and seal them with a clear, paintable caulk.
*   **Check the Exterior:** Look for where the ant trail was entering your home from the outside and seal that crack as well. Trim back any vegetation that is touching your siding, as this can act as a bridge for ants.

### FAQ

**Q: I used the bait, and now I see more ants than ever! Did it fail?**
A: No, that's a sign that it is working perfectly! A successful bait placement will attract a large number of ants from the colony. This "swarm" is exactly what you want to see. They are actively consuming the bait and carrying it back to the nest. Resist the urge to interfere, and the activity should die down completely within a week.

**Q: Can I just use a spray? It's faster.**
A: Spraying is the least effective thing you can do for a sugar ant problem. It only kills the 1% of the colony that is out foraging for food. The nest, which is the other 99%, remains unharmed. The queen will simply produce more workers to replace the ones you killed, and the problem will return.

**Q: What if the ants are ignoring my bait?**
A: Ants can be picky eaters. Their dietary needs can shift between sugars and proteins. If they are ignoring your sweet bait, they may be looking for grease or protein. You can try a different type of bait (a protein-based one) or simply place a tiny dab of peanut butter next to your sweet bait to see which one they are more attracted to.
