# Why do fleas keep coming back?

Fleas thrive excellently in warm summer months and wet spring months but may appear at any time. However, after the flea appears in your residence, getting rid of them will be a daunting task. While you start on the journey to fight fleas in your residence and on your dog, fleas have a particular advantage that makes them very hardy.

Here the particular flea advantages: **Biological advantages** Flea has very back legs with significant muscle powers.

The powerful legs enable the pest to jump about 1 foot vertically and 4-5 feet horizontally. These biological features allow the flea to navigate from one host to another and hide from different insect control mechanisms. **Advanced and long life cycle** Female fleas lay many eggs, about 30 eggs, in a day, and thus have a high reproduction rate. The eggs are also tiny and can thus hide on your dog or in cracks, crevices, and carpets.

The eggs' lightweight allows the dog to carry them around your house and fall off in different locations in your residence. Flea eggs hatch within one week, which could delay waiting for the right conditions. After hatching, the eggs turn into larvae. The flea larvae create cocoons, and they move into them to grow into pupae, which takes about 1 week.

However, fleas in the cocoon can survive for 6 months if they are not favorable to become adults.

Also, a female flea can survive for about 1. 5 years. **Fleas have good hiding** abilities. For each flea that you spot in your facility, there could be other hundreds hiding in different locations such as under carpets and cracks. The fleas that are hiding could be in different developmental stages: larvae, eggs, and cocoons.

Therefore, it would be helpful to use products such as the best fogger for fleas in your home when there is a major infestation. A flea can survive without feeding.

**Surprisingly! ** Fleas are capable of surviving for a long time without feeding. For example, after one blood feeding, the flea can survive for one month. Various insect controlling chemicals such as sprays and foggers are good at fighting adult fleas. However, I recommend that you use [natural pest control concentrate](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A755Q3O/?tag=p-policy-20)to kill fleas in all their developmental stages.

##  Prevent flea re-infestation on your dog?

###  **Step #1: Control Fleas outside the house**

Do you have a lawn outside your house? That should be your first concern while you are aiming to prevent flea infestation on your dog. Lawns form an excellent residence for fleas, their eggs, and larvae. Fleas love living in the grass, and from there, they can hop and jump onto any animal, including you and your dog, that passes on the lawn. Therefore, you should cut the grass short to enable heat from the sun to get to the roots.

Such a condition would make the fleas uncomfortable, and thus fleas would not hide there. Also, you can sprinkle Diatomaceous Earth (DE) on the lawn. The Diatomaceous Earth would break the fleas skins, absorb its moisture and thus kill them. Further, sprinkle the powder in the pets house and around your house.

###  **Step #2: Treat you Dog to fleas**

After tackling the fleas from outside your house, it is now time to kill or prevent any fleas that would like to make your dog their host. There are many products available to treat fleas on your dog and cats. Ensure to read online buyer reviews and talk to your vet to learn the best practices for flea prevention and control.

Despite that you might consider cats and dogs as almost equals, it is critical to note that some dog flea treatment chemicals can harm your cat.

Therefore, please consult with your vet, read label instructions, and adhere to them!
