Bed bug look-alikes often make it hard to identify bed bugs, which eventually results in wrong eradication methods. If you dont know the characteristics of common of bugs in your house, it is possible to mistake them [for bed bugs](https://pestpolicy.com/best-bed-bug-steamer/).

As a homeowner, you dont want to go wrong with your bed bug eradication strategies. Here is a list of the most common bed bug look-a likes.

##  **Bugs That Look Like Bed Bugs**

###  1. Bat bugs

**Colour: ** Dark brown or beige **Description: ** Among other bugs, bat bugs have the greatest resemblance to bed bugs. Perhaps only an expert can differentiate between the two using a microscope.

You cant tell the difference by looking at their color or shape. One of the most notable difference is their hair on the thorax. Bat bugs have longer hair than bed bugs.

While bed bugs feed on human blood, bat bugs feed on bat blood. However, in the absence of bats, bat bugs will feed on blood from other hosts including humans. - **Size: **3-5mm or in - **Shape: **Oval - **Do bat bugs have wings? **The wings on bat bugs are non-functional. - **Do bat bugs bite? **Their bite is just as irritating as a bed bug bite. **Where are bat bugs found? ** The name bat bug does not mean that they nest on the backs of bats.

It rather depicts their adaptation to live in areas nested by bats as they feed on their blood.

Apart from caves, bats can live in many other places. So its possible to find bat bugs just anywhere including our houses.

###  2. Spider Beetles

**Colour: ** Their color ranges from yellow to brown to near black. **Description: ** Spider beetles have a common resemblance to spiders owing to their small oval body and long legs.

But they are also easily mistaken for bed bugs because most of them are reddish brown in color.

They are however smaller than bed bugs and have wings that are covered with hairs. Unlike bed bugs, spider beetles have two body segments (head connects to the body without a neck). - **Size: **1/32 in-3/16 in or 1-5mm - **Shape: **Oval - **Do Spider Beetles have wings? **They have wings but only a few species can fly - **Do Spider Beetles bite? **They dont bite **Where are Spider Beetles found?

** They inhabit wooden structures [and carpets](https://pestpolicy.com/can-[bed-bugs](https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bug-bites-vs-mosquito-bites/)-live-in-carpet/)where they can easily access stored food.

###  3. Cockroach Nymphs

**Colour: ** Reddish-brown **Description: ** Cockroach nymphs bear a lot of similarity to adult [bed](https://pestpolicy.com/bed-bug-bites-vs-other-bites/)bugs, especially in their size and color. When lodged in their favourite narrow cracks, youll easily confuse them for bed bugs. - **Size: **2 in long - **Shape: **Cylindrical - **Do Cockroach Nymphs have wings? **Cockroach nymphs have no wings - **Do Cockroach Nymphs bite?

**They dont bite **Where are Cockroach Nymphs found?

They can be distinguished from bed bugs by their hard skeleton and antennae. - **Size: **Adults are 1/16-1/8-inch or 2. 0-3. 8mm. - **Shape: **Oval - **Do Carpet beetles have wings? **Adult carpet beetles have wings which they use to fly during the day. - **Do Carpet beetles bite? **They dont bite but their presence can trigger allergic dermatitis in humans. **Where are Carpet beetles found? ** They usually inhabit fabrics, especially carpets.

Sometimes they can be confused with clothes moths

###  5. Swallow Bugs

**Colour: ** Reddish-brown **Description: ** They belong to the family Cimicidae, just like bed bugs. Physically, they resemble the bed bugs in their shape, size and color.

Notable differences between the two include the long antennae segment and the long hair on the body of swallow bugs. These can only be seen under a microscope.

Another distinction is perhaps their feeding habits. While bed bugs feed on human blood, swallow bugs feed on the blood of birds, specifically swallows. - **Size: **3/16 in - **Shape: **Oval - **Do Swallow Bugs have wings? **They dont have wings. - **Do Swallow Bugs bite? **They bite humans when swallows abandon their nests during the breeding seasons. **Where are Swallow Bugs found?

** Typically, swallows bugs live in nests inhabited by swallow so as to feed on their blood.

Usually, swallows abandon their nests when they become heavily infested with swallow bugs.

Swallow bugs can survive in the nests for up to one year without blood, especially when swallows are breeding.

###  6. Fleas

**Colour: ** Reddish-brown. **Description: ** Fleas are smaller than bed bugs with a bilaterally flattened body (body is taller than is flat).

They like feeding on blood from hairy or furry warm-blooded animals such dogs and cats.

They are also commonly found on potted plants, wallpapers and furniture.

###  8. Headlice

**Colour: ** Color ranges from white to grey. Color changes to slightly brown after feeding. **Description: ** Headlice are wingless insects and smaller than bed bugs. While both bed bugs and headlice feed on human blood, it possible to differentiate the two by their feeding habits.
