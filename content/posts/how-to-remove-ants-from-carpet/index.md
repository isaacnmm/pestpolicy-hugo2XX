Most ants that you are seeing on your carpet are there because they were attracted by something. Food droppings are the first thing that attracts them to your house and the carpet. You can control them by:

###  **1. Using Ant Carpet Powder**

Anti-ant carpet powder is a pest control product that is used to control ants. If ants have all over the carpet, you can use this powder to control them. This powder is very effective especially when the ants infestation is much. With this powder, all you need is to sprinkle it on the carpet and the ants will start dying immediately. - Those that are lucky will run but cannot survive for long before they die.

- When that is done, you can clean your carpet with a vacuum cleaner or by other means. Be cautious because it can be harmful to you, your children, or your pets. Always wear gloves before using them and keep the children and pets when sprinkling. Remember to do vacuum clean the carpet,

###  **2. Using Baits **

This is so far the best way to rid the carpets from your carpet. But this only works if the level of an ant infestation is low. - Unlike the powder, you set the baits as food to the ants. They are placed around the carpet so that the ants can pick is as food and take them to the nest. - Upon eating all the ants in the nest will die. The bait kills the ants from the source but if the ants are many, it, may not be the best method of control.

The good part with using baits is that your carpet remains clean from the dirt of dead ants. It is also safer to use even when you have kids and pets in the house. As a precaution, baits are more effective if kept around the carpet. Apart from the carpets, you can also set these baits on other parts of the house like the kitchen and bedroom among others.
