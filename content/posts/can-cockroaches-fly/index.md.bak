Pennsylvania Wood Cockroach (Only males can fly) For Pennsylvania Wood Cockroach, its evident that just the male roaches have the capability to fly.

However, the male Pennsylvania Wood Cockroach has poorly developed wings and will only fly for short distances.

Further, this roach species tend to be attracted to light sources, such as light bulbs, and tend to fly in that direction. **4. Smokybrown Cockroach (Males and females are flyers)** **Color**: Smoky brown [Cockroach](https://entomology.unl.edu/scilit/Urban%20Pest%20Profile-%20Smoky%20Brown%20Roach%20Amanda%20Newton.pdf)has a shiny brown-blackish cover. **Wings and Length**: The adult roaches are about 1. 25 inches.

They love chimneys and flat rooftops which is how they can enter your home. Other facts on this roach are that it is nocturnal, and hence youll find it running up and down during the evening hours.

##  **At 80 degrees, Some Roaches become frequent flyers.**

Surprisingly, some roaches fly while trying to hide from the sweltering heat. So besides just crawling up the house drains, roaches might fly to get into your home. The most common household roaches (the American cockroaches) do not generally fly and dont regularly use their wings. Further, cold temperatures such as during winter and what you find down drains and sewers prevent them from using their flight muscles.

However, if the temperature rises to about 80 degrees and above (like with the summer weather), the American roaches will definitely become regular fliers. The hot weather also tends to increase the roaches metabolism and reproduction capacity, leading to an even higher roach population.

##  **Conclusion**

Different roach species have a variedflying ability. However, roaches are not good flyers.

As noted above, American Cockroaches (both males and females) are good flyers.

However, other roach species may use their wings to glide or jump from higher to lower areas.
