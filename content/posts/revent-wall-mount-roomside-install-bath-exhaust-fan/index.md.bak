## ReVent Wall Mount Roomside Install Bath Exhaust Fan: Key Features
The ReVent fan is designed with innovation at its core, addressing common installation challenges and user demands for performance and quiet operation.

### 1. Roomside Installation Capability (The Game Changer)

* **No Attic Access Required:** This is the standout feature. The entire fan housing, motor, and grille can be installed or replaced entirely from the bathroom side of the ceiling or wall. This eliminates the need for crawling into dusty, cramped attics or navigating tight crawl spaces, making installation significantly easier, faster, and safer for homeowners and installers alike.

* **Ideal for Challenging Spaces:** Perfect for bathrooms on the ground floor, basements with finished ceilings, apartments, condos, or any situation where attic access is difficult or impossible. It also simplifies replacement of existing fans without attic entry.

### 2. Versatile Wall and Ceiling Mount Design

* **Dual Compatibility:** Unlike many fans designed for either ceiling or wall, the ReVent fan is engineered to be installed in both orientations. This flexibility allows homeowners to choose the best ventilation point for their specific bathroom layout  directly over a shower in a ceiling, or through an exterior wall.

* **Direct Wall Venting:** When mounted on an exterior wall, it provides a very short, direct path for humid air to exhaust outside, minimizing ductwork and potential airflow loss.

### 3. High Performance with Quiet Operation

* **Optimized CFM Ratings:** ReVent fans are available in various CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) ratings (e.g., 80 CFM, 110 CFM, etc.) to suit different bathroom sizes. This ensures effective removal of moisture and odors. (Always size your fan correctly using a CFM calculator based on your bathroom's square footage or volume). * **Low Sone Ratings:** A significant focus for modern bathroom fans, ReVent models boast impressively low sone ratings (often 1.0 sone or less).
This means they operate almost silently, providing powerful ventilation without intrusive noise, enhancing bathroom comfort.

### 4. Efficient DC Motor Technology (in many models)

* **Energy Efficiency:** Many ReVent fans utilize advanced DC (Direct Current) motor technology, which is inherently more energy-efficient than traditional AC motors. This translates to lower electricity consumption and reduced utility bills over time. * **Consistent Performance:** DC motors often offer more consistent airflow performance across varying static pressures (due to ductwork) and can be more reliable.

### 5. Durable Construction and Thoughtful Design

* **Galvanized Steel Housing:** The fan housing is typically made from robust galvanized steel, providing durability and corrosion resistance in humid bathroom environments. * **Integrated Damper:** Features a built-in backdraft damper to prevent cold air, hot air, and pests from entering the bathroom when the fan is off. * **White Grille:** Comes with a clean, unobtrusive white grille that blends seamlessly with most bathroom decors. The grille is usually easy to remove for cleaning.

### 6. Quick-Connect Wiring and Easy Duct Connection

* **Simplified Electrical Hookup:** Designed with quick-connect wire connectors, simplifying the electrical wiring process. * **Flexible Duct Collar:** Features a flexible duct collar that rotates, allowing for easier alignment and connection to existing or new ductwork, whether it's a ceiling or wall installation. This adaptability speeds up installation and ensures a secure, airtight seal (when used with duct clamps and HVAC-grade foil tape).

### 7. Optional Integrated Features

* **Fan-Light Combinations:** Many ReVent models offer integrated LED lighting, providing both ventilation and illumination from a single fixture. Some may include night light features. * **Humidity Sensing (Humidistat):** Higher-end models may include a humidistat sensor that automatically turns the fan on when humidity levels rise and off when they drop, ensuring optimal moisture control and energy savings without manual intervention.

### 8. HVI Certified

* **Independent Verification:** ReVent fans are HVI (Home Ventilating Institute) certified. This means their CFM and sone ratings have been independently tested and verified, assuring consumers that the performance claims are accurate and reliable.
