##  Buyer's Guide:Best Snake Repellent for Yard

###  1. Tips for Repelling Snakes

Though the products mentioned above work to repel snakes and keep them from invading your yard for some time, there are directions to be followed.

To get started, you have to ensure that you cut grass and clear the clutter. That way, you will have an easy time targeting the areas used by snakes to find their way into your house.

You should check the label of products and follow the directions provided by the manufacturing company. You will learn that some of them require a lot of water, while some come application-ready.

Since some repellents might contain harmful chemicals, make sure to put on protective garments while applying them.

###  2. Does Lime Keep Snakes Away?

Many have been taught to use lime to keep snakes off their turf. However, there is no scientific proof to back this claim.

You might have been told that by putting lime around your property, you will prevent snakes from entering your compound. Though this might sound a great idea, lime does nothing to prevent snakes from entering your home.

Also, you need to understand that instead, lime is a substance that can be dangerous to your loved ones and pets. It has been reported that lime causes severe skin burn, which is why you should avoid it.

###  3. Does salt keep snakes away?

Many studies have been conducted to confirm whether salt could be used to keep snakes away from home. It is accurate to state that nothing has been found to work.

Instead, the products that contain salt are formulated with other chemicals that might harm your health. It is essential to consider using methods that have been studied and proven to work.

If anything, snakes do not feed on salt, which is why you cant feed them salt to kill them. Also, salt does not dehydrate snakes, so they will just walk through it and invade your home.

If your property is snake-infested, consider using any of the methods mentioned on this list, and you will be safe.

###  4. Do Mothballs repel snakes?

There is no way you can use mothballs to repel snakes. There is nothing special about mothballs that can make them keep snakes from invading your property.

You need to know that mothballs are a kind of poison and might cause severe damage to your red blood cells. Therefore, you should not even think about using them to control snakes in your home. Worse still, mothballs are known to cause liver failure.

Instead, if you apply mothballs in your garden, you will not do any harm to snakes, but end up poisoning the land. Snakes are dangerous animals, and if you are going to control them, you should use a reliable method.

##  Conclusion

There are many types of snake repellents on the market. As a potential buyer, you need to check that a given repellent has effective ingredients that will not harm you and your loved ones.
