The familiar hum of a lawn [mower](https://pestpolicy.com/problem-with-lawn-mower-engine-running-rough/)is a quintessential sound of spring and summer, signifying well-maintained yards and outdoor enjoyment. Yet, beneath this seemingly innocuous routine lies a serious potential for injury. [Lawn](https://pestpolicy.com/10-essential-lawn-and-garden-tools-for-fall/)mowers, whether push, ride-on, or robotic, are powerful machines designed to cut, and they demand respect and careful handling.

Each year, thousands of individuals, including children, suffer severe and often preventable injuries from improper mower operation.

Ensuring lawn mower safety is not just about avoiding minor scrapes; it's about preventing life-altering accidents involving blade lacerations, amputations, severe cuts, and even eye injuries from thrown objects. This guide is designed to equip homeowners with essential knowledge, from understanding the sobering statistics of mower-related incidents to implementing crucial safety protocols before you even start the engine.

We'll also cover what steps to take if an accident unfortunately occurs, reinforcing the critical importance of vigilance every time you tackle your lawn.

##  The Statistics Surrounding Lawn Mower Accidents

The numbers paint a stark picture of the dangers associated with lawn mowers, highlighting the urgent need for heightened awareness and preventative measures. While often perceived as benign household tools, lawn mowers are responsible for a significant number of injuries annually, many of which are severe.

According to data from the **U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)**, lawn mowers are consistently among the top products associated with emergency room-treated injuries. While specific yearly numbers fluctuate, trends show:

* **Tens of Thousands of Injuries Annually: ** On average, over **80, 000 people** in the United States seek emergency medical treatment for lawn mower-related injuries each year. * **Common Injuries: ** The most frequent injuries include severe lacerations (cuts), amputations (fingers, toes, or even limbs), fractures, avulsions (tearing away of body tissue), and eye injuries caused by thrown objects.

* **Amputations: ** Lawn mowers are a leading cause of traumatic amputations, particularly to fingers and toes. Estimates suggest over 9, 000 amputations annually are due to lawn mower accidents. * **Children are Highly Vulnerable: ** A significant percentage of these injuries, particularly amputations, involve children.

Tragically, children are often victims of either riding mowers (falling off, being run over, or being backed over) or push mowers (placing hands/feet in discharge chutes or under blades). The **American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS)** reports that over 13, 000 children are treated for lawn mower injuries each year, with almost half of these occurring in children under the age of 5.

* **Riding Mower vs. Push Mower: ** While push mowers are responsible for many lacerations due to direct contact with blades, riding mowers can cause more severe crushing injuries, run-over incidents, and rollovers on uneven terrain. * **Thrown Object Injuries: ** Beyond direct blade contact, objects (rocks, sticks, toys) ejected at high speed from the mower's discharge chute cause thousands of eye injuries and other blunt force traumas.

These statistics underscore that lawn mower accidents are a serious public health concern, often resulting in long-term disability, costly medical treatments, and profound emotional distress for victims and their families. Almost all these incidents are preventable with proper safety practices.

##  Safety Tips Before You Start Your Lawn Mower

Preparation is paramount when it comes to lawn mower safety. Before you even think about pulling the cord or turning the key, follow these crucial steps:

1. **Read the Owner's Manual: ** This is your primary safety guide. Every mower is different, and the manual contains specific instructions, warnings, and maintenance guidelines unique to your model. Familiarize yourself with all controls, especially how to quickly shut off the machine.

2. **Inspect Your Mower: ** * **Blades: ** Check that blades are sharp and securely fastened. Dull blades tear grass, requiring more effort and potentially making the mower less stable. * **Guards and Safety Features: ** Ensure all safety guards, shields, and the discharge chute are in place and in good working order. Never operate a mower with missing or damaged safety devices.

* **Controls: ** Test the emergency stop (bail bar on push mowers, kill switch on riders) to ensure it functions instantly. * **Fuel & Oil: ** Check fuel and oil levels *before* starting. Never refuel a hot engine. * **Loose Parts: ** Look for loose nuts, bolts, or damaged components.

3. **Prepare Your Lawn: ** * **Clear Debris: ** Walk the entire lawn and remove any rocks, sticks, toys, wires, hoses, or other objects that could be picked up by the blades and thrown. Thrown objects are a leading cause of injury. * **Identify Hazards: ** Note any dips, holes, roots, or hidden obstacles that could cause you to trip, slip, or the mower to overturn.

* **Slope Awareness: ** Identify slopes and plan to mow across them with a push mower, not up and down (to prevent slipping).

For riding mowers, mow up and down slopes, not across, to reduce the risk of rollovers. Avoid mowing excessively steep slopes. * **Dry Grass: ** Only mow dry grass. Wet grass is slippery, clogs the mower, and can make you lose your footing.

4. **Dress for Safety (Personal Protective Equipment - PPE): ** * **Eye Protection: ** Always wear safety glasses or goggles to protect against thrown debris. * **Hearing Protection: ** Mowers are loud. Earplugs or earmuffs protect your hearing. * **Closed-Toe Shoes: ** Wear sturdy, non-slip, closed-toe shoes (like work boots), never sandals or bare feet. * **Long Pants: ** Wear long pants to protect your legs from flying debris and minor cuts.

* **Gloves (Optional but Recommended): ** Can provide better grip and protect hands.

5. **Ensure a Safe Environment: ** * **No Children or Pets: ** Absolutely no children or pets should be in the yard while you are mowing. Keep them inside or well away from the mowing area. Young children are especially vulnerable to being run over or struck by thrown objects. * **Maintain Distance: ** Keep bystanders (especially children) at least 100 feet away from the mowing area.

* **Avoid Distractions: ** Do not use headphones that block out ambient noise, and avoid using your phone.

Stay focused on the task. * **Never Leave Running: ** Never leave a running mower unattended, even for a moment. * **Supervise Children: ** If children are old enough to help, supervise them closely and educate them on all safety protocols. Children under 12 should not operate push mowers; children under 16 should not operate riding mowers.

##  What to Do If a Mowing Accident Occurs

Despite all precautions, accidents can happen. Knowing how to react quickly and effectively can minimize harm.

**For Minor Injuries (e. g. , small cuts, scrapes): ** 1. **Stop the Mower Immediately: ** Activate the kill switch or release the bail bar. If a riding mower, turn off the engine and remove the key. 2. **Assess the Injury: ** Determine the severity of the wound. 3. **Clean the Wound: ** Wash the area with soap and water. 4. **Apply Pressure: ** Use a clean cloth or sterile gauze to apply direct pressure to stop any bleeding. 5.

**Bandage: ** Cover the wound with a sterile bandage. 6.

**Monitor: ** Watch for signs of infection (redness, swelling, pus, increased pain).

**For Serious Injuries (e. g. , deep lacerations, amputations, severe bleeding, suspected fractures, eye injuries): ** 1. **Immediately Shut Down the Mower: ** This is the absolute first step. Ensure it cannot accidentally restart. 2. **Call Emergency Services (911 or local equivalent): ** Do this without delay. Provide a clear description of the injury and your location. 3.

**Control Bleeding: ** Apply firm, direct pressure to the wound using a clean cloth, sterile dressing, or even your hand.

If direct pressure is insufficient and the injury is on a limb, elevate the limb if possible. For severe, uncontrolled bleeding, a tourniquet may be necessary as a last resort *if you have been trained in its use*. 4. **DO NOT Wash Deep Wounds: ** For deep cuts or amputations, do not attempt to clean the wound. Your priority is to stop bleeding. 5. **Preserve Amputated Parts: ** If a body part has been amputated: * Retrieve the severed part.

* Rinse it gently with clean water.

* Wrap it in a clean, damp cloth or sterile gauze. * Place it in a sealed plastic bag. * Place that bag on ice in a cooler. **Do not let the severed part touch the ice directly. ** This helps preserve the tissue for potential reattachment. * Ensure the severed part accompanies the patient to the hospital. 6. **Stay Calm and Reassure: ** Keep the injured person calm and warm, covering them with a blanket if necessary to prevent shock. 7.

**Do NOT Move the Injured Person** if you suspect a back, neck, or severe limb injury, unless they are in immediate danger (e. g. , fire). 8. **Eye Injuries: ** If something gets in the eye, do not rub it. Rinse gently with clean water. If a foreign object is embedded, do not try to remove it. Cover the eye with a clean cloth or cup and seek immediate medical attention.
