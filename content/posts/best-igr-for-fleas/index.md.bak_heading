##  IGRs and Flea Control
- Selecting the Best IGR

There are 2 major classifications of IGRs for fleas, based on 1. The active ingredient 2. Added chemicals like knockdowns and synergists **1. (S)
- Hydroprene** The active ingredient in Gentrol is [(S)
- Hydroprene](http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/hydropregen.pdf).This chemical has been found to work for killing both fleas, moths, beetles, and cockroaches.
- The knockdown in Gentrol has been found to work for killing both adult fleas and their larvae.
- This IGR can be used on carpets, upholstery, cracks and crevices, non
- food areas where pets are present indoors only. **2. Pyriproxifen** [Pyriproxifen](http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/pyriprogen.html)is another IGR for fleas that are applied directly to your dogs and cats.
- This chemical has been found to work for killing larval stages of fleas, as well as moths, cockroaches, beetles, and ants.
- The knockdown in this product has also proven useful against adult fleas indoors only on carpets or upholstery with no food present. It can be used outdoors if pets are not around but it must stay dry when applied outside because rain and direct sunlight will affect its effectiveness. **3.

Dinotefuran** [Dinotefuran](http://ipm.ucanr.edu/TOOLS/PNAI/pnaishow.php?id=29)is classified as a [**neonicotinoid**](https://citybugs.tamu.edu/factsheets/ipm/what
- is
- a
- neonicotinoid/)as it'll damage the fleas nerve synapses' receptors in the CNS. This is an insecticide, not an IGR. Sentinel is a fast
- acting product that works as an adulticide, and its residual effect will last for about 3 months. **3.

Methoprene** [Methoprene](http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/methogen.html)is available in either r
- methoprene or s
- methoprene and it's a good choice for fleas because of its low toxicity to humans, pets, and wildlife. S
- methoprene works like an IGR; it's sprayed around on the carpets or upholstery.
- This product should be used as soon as possible to prevent new eggs from hatching.
- If you choose this option it's important not to let it dry out because rain will wash the chemical away before it has been able to activate. **4. Prallethrin** [Prallethrin](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/180.545)is an insecticide from the [**pyrethroid**](http://www.npic.orst.edu/factsheets/pyrethrins.pdf)family and it's often used alongside an IGR.

Prallethrin is a chemical generally used for the control of food
- contaminating and nuisance insects like ticks, fleas, roaches, and ants.
