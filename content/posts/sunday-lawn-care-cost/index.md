In the evolving landscape of home lawn care, [Sunday](https://pestpolicy.com/sunday-lawn-care-reviews/)has carved out a unique niche, appealing to homeowners who seek a more eco-conscious, convenient, and personalized approach to nurturing their green spaces.

Unlike traditional professional [lawn](https://pestpolicy.com/sunday-lawn-care-vs-scotts/)care services that send technicians to your property, Sunday operates on a direct-to-consumer model, delivering customized nutrient plans and supplemental treatments right to your doorstep, designed for DIY application.

For many interested individuals, the immediate question that arises is: "How much does Sunday Lawn Care actually cost? " Understanding the financial investment is crucial for determining if this subscription-based service aligns with your budget and lawn care philosophy.

While I, as an AI, cannot provide real-time, exact pricing (as costs can fluctuate based on promotions, lawn size, location, and plan specifics), this article will comprehensively break down Sunday's pricing structure.

We will explore what influences the cost, how to estimate your potential expenses, and ultimately, help you evaluate if Sunday offers a worthwhile investment for your lawn care journey.

##  What Does Sunday Offer?

Sunday Lawn Care distinguishes itself by focusing on a more natural approach to lawn nutrition, primarily through soil-friendly ingredients. Their core offering revolves around a personalized subscription plan tailored to your specific lawn's needs.

* **Customized Lawn Plan: ** This is the cornerstone of Sunday's service. Upon signing up, users typically provide information about their lawn's size, grass type, and location. Sunday then uses this data, combined with local climate and soil information, to create a bespoke nutrient plan. This plan includes a series of liquid fertilizer pouches designed for specific seasonal applications.

* **Nutrient Pouches: ** These liquid formulations are typically made with ingredients like seaweed, molasses, iron, and other plant-derived components. They are designed to be easily applied using a standard garden hose and a provided sprayer attachment. * **Seasonal Shipments: ** The customized plan is delivered in shipments throughout the growing season, timed for optimal application.

* **Soil Test Kit (Optional/Included in some plans): ** Many users can opt for (or receive) a soil test kit, which provides detailed insights into their soil's specific nutrient deficiencies and pH levels, allowing for an even more precise custom plan. * **Add-on Solutions: ** Beyond the core nutrient plan, Sunday offers a range of supplemental products that can be purchased individually or sometimes bundled with plans.

These include: * **Weed Control: ** Often iron-based sprays designed to selectively kill broadleaf weeds. * **Pest Control: ** Solutions for common lawn insects like grubs, ants, and sometimes mosquitos, often with natural or low-toxicity ingredients. * **Grass Seed: ** Various types of grass seed suited for different regions and repair needs.

* **Specific Soil Amendments: ** Products addressing issues like compaction or specific nutrient deficiencies.

* **Educational Resources and Support: ** Sunday provides extensive online resources, application guides, and access to a team of lawn advisors to assist homeowners.

##  Sundays Subscription Pricing

Sunday's primary pricing model is a subscription for their customized lawn plan, delivered in multiple shipments throughout the year. The cost of this subscription is **not a fixed, flat rate** for all customers. Instead, it is highly personalized and primarily determined by the following factors:

* **Lawn Size: ** This is the most significant determinant. The larger your lawn (in square footage), the more product is needed, and thus the higher the subscription cost. Sunday's pricing tiers typically increase with square footage. * **Number of Shipments/Applications: ** A standard plan usually includes 3-4 shipments per year, but some premium plans or specific lawn needs might necessitate more, impacting the total annual cost.

* **Location: ** Geographic location can influence pricing due to variations in shipping costs, regional product formulations, and market competition. * **Customization Level: ** While the base nutrient plan is customized, opting for additional "boosts" or solutions integrated into your seasonal shipments can increase the overall price.

When you go to Sunday's website and enter your address and lawn size, their system calculates an estimated annual cost for your customized base plan. This annual cost is then typically broken down into payments per shipment.

##  Sundays Individual Product Pricing

Beyond the main subscription plan, Sunday also sells a variety of individual products, which can be purchased separately without a subscription or as add-ons to an existing plan. These individual products cover specific needs like targeted weed control, pest solutions, or grass seed.

* **Weed Control Sprays: ** Products like "Weed Warrior" for broadleaf weeds typically cost in the range of **$20 - $35 per bottle**, depending on the size and concentration. * **Pest Control Solutions: ** Solutions for common insects (e. g. , mosquito, grub, ant control) can range from **$25 - $50+ per application bottle**, again varying by product and coverage.

* **Grass Seed: ** Sunday offers various grass seed blends, with costs ranging from **$20 - $70+ per bag**, depending on the type of seed and the area it covers. * **Specialty Nutrients/Amendments: ** Specific supplements for areas like trees, shrubs, or specific soil issues will have their own pricing, typically similar to weed/pest solutions.

These individual products offer flexibility, allowing users to address specific problems as they arise or supplement their core plan without committing to a full bundled subscription for every solution.

##  Factors that Influence Sunday Lawn Care Cost

To reiterate and expand, several key factors directly impact the total amount you will pay for Sunday Lawn Care:

1. **Lawn Size (Square Footage): ** This is paramount. Sunday's algorithm heavily relies on this to calculate product volume. An accurate measurement of your lawn's actively turfed area (excluding house, driveways, garden beds) is crucial. 2. **Location/Climate Zone: ** Different regions have different growing seasons and common lawn challenges, which can influence the specific products in your plan and their frequency, thereby affecting cost.

Shipping costs also vary regionally. 3.

**Selected Plan Customization: ** Choosing a basic nutrient plan will be less expensive than opting for a plan that automatically includes solutions for weeds, pests, or specific soil issues throughout the year. 4. **Frequency of Shipments: ** While most standard plans are 3-4 shipments, any adjustments to this frequency based on your lawn's needs or your preferences will impact the total annual cost. 5.

**Add-on Purchases: ** Any individual products purchased outside of your core subscription plan (e. g. , extra weed killer, specific pest control, grass seed) will add to your overall expenditure. 6. **Promotions and Discounts: ** Sunday, like many subscription services, frequently offers introductory discounts, seasonal promotions, or bundle savings. Taking advantage of these can significantly reduce your initial cost.

##  Sunday Lawn Care Cost Calculation

To get an estimate for your specific lawn's cost, the best way is to visit Sunday's official website. Here's a general outline of the process they use and what you'll need:

1. **Enter Your Address: ** Sunday's system uses satellite imagery and property data to estimate your lawn's square footage. 2. **Verify Lawn Size: ** You'll typically be given a chance to confirm or adjust the estimated lawn size. Be as accurate as possible. 3.

**Receive Your Personalized Plan & Quote: ** Based on your location, grass type (often inferred or asked), and lawn size, Sunday will present a proposed annual plan, detailing the number of shipments and the cost per shipment or the total annual cost. 4. **Customize Your Plan: ** At this stage, you might have options to add specific weed control, pest control, or other solutions to your annual plan, which will update the quoted price.

For example, a small urban lawn (e. g. , 2, 500 sq ft) might see an annual cost in the range of **$100-$150** for a basic nutrient plan, while a larger suburban lawn (e. g. , 10, 000 sq ft) could range from **$200-$400+** for the base plan. Adding additional services or premium plans would increase these figures. Always get a direct quote from Sunday for your specific property.

##  Is Sunday Worth the Money?

Determining if Sunday Lawn Care is "worth the money" is highly subjective and depends on individual priorities, expectations, and the current condition of your lawn.

**Consider Sunday Worth It If: ** * **You prioritize natural/eco-friendly inputs: ** If using synthetic chemicals is a concern, Sunday's approach aligns well. * **You enjoy DIY but want guidance: ** You like being hands-on but appreciate a customized plan, pre-measured products, and expert support. * **Your lawn has moderate issues: ** For general health, greening, and minor weed prevention, Sunday can be very effective.

* **Convenience is key: ** Having products delivered and easy to apply saves time and trips to the store. * **Your lawn is not severely neglected: ** For lawns with major weed infestations, compacted soil, or severe diseases, Sunday's less aggressive approach might require more patience or initial manual effort.

**Consider Alternatives If: ** * **You seek immediate, aggressive results: ** Particularly for severe weed or pest problems, conventional synthetic solutions might act faster. * **You want a completely hands-off service: ** If you prefer never to touch a sprayer, a professional service is a better fit.

* **Your budget is extremely tight: ** While competitive for its niche, it might be more expensive than purchasing generic synthetic fertilizers in bulk.

* **You have severe lawn problems: ** For major overhauls, you might need a professional initial consultation and treatment.

Ultimately, the "worth" comes down to how much you value convenience, natural ingredients, customization, and DIY involvement versus pure cost savings or immediate, aggressive problem eradication.

##  Professional vs. DIY Lawn Care

When considering Sunday, it's helpful to compare it against the two main alternatives: traditional professional lawn care and entirely DIY lawn care.

* **Professional Lawn Care (e. g. , TruGreen, local companies): ** * **
Pros:

- ** Completely hands-off, expert application, often aggressive treatment for severe issues, can include services like aeration and dethatching. * **Cons: ** Can be more expensive overall, less control over products used, technicians on property, sometimes uses harsher chemicals.

* **Cost: ** Generally higher annual cost than Sunday's base plan (e. g. , $400-$800+ for a medium lawn).

* **Traditional DIY Lawn Care (Buying products at a store): ** * **
Pros:

- ** Potentially the lowest cost (especially if using generic synthetics), full control over products and timing. * **Cons: ** Requires significant knowledge, time for research and application, purchasing/storing various products, potential for misapplication, often uses synthetic products.

* **Cost: ** Highly variable, but potentially as low as $100-$300 annually for a medium lawn with basic synthetic products.

* **Sunday Lawn Care (DIY with Guidance): ** * **
Pros:

- ** Personalized plans, natural-focus, convenient delivery, easier application than traditional DIY, educational support. * **Cons: ** Requires homeowner application, potentially less aggressive on severe problems than professional services or strong synthetics, moderate cost.

Sunday bridges the gap, offering personalization and convenience that goes beyond typical DIY, but requiring more active participation than professional services.
