Removing a small tree from your yard can seem like a daunting task, but for trees that are genuinely small and pose minimal risk, it's a manageable DIY project. Whether you're clearing space for new landscaping, dealing with an unwanted sapling, or removing a tree that has simply outgrown its spot, understanding the proper techniques is crucial for both your safety and the health of your garden.

Unlike large tree removals that demand professional arborists and heavy machinery, a small tree can often be tackled with basic tools and a careful, methodical approach.

This guide will walk you through the essential steps of safely cutting down a small tree, removing its stump and roots, and identifying the right tools for the job. We'll also cover cost considerations and help you determine when it's best to call in the professionals, ensuring you tackle your small tree removal project effectively and without incident.

##  Step 1: Plan Your Cut

Before you even touch a saw, thorough planning is essential. This is the most critical step for ensuring safety and efficiency.

* **Assess the Tree's Size: ** This guide is for "small" trees, generally considered to be those with a trunk diameter of **less than 15 cm (6 inches) at chest height** and a height that won't reach any structures or power lines if it falls. If the tree is larger than this, or if there's *any* doubt about its fall path, stop and consider hiring a professional.

* **Identify the Fall Direction: ** Observe the tree's natural lean, the distribution of its branches, and the prevailing wind direction.

This will help you predict which way the tree will most likely fall. * **Clear the Fall Zone: ** Once you've determined the fall direction, clear a safe zone that is at least twice the height of the tree. Remove any garden furniture, pots, tools, or anything else that could be damaged. Ensure no people or pets can enter this area during the cutting process.

* **Establish an Escape Route: ** Plan a clear path for yourself to retreat immediately after making the cut.

This route should be away from the tree's fall direction and any potential rolling logs. * **Check for Obstructions: ** Look up for power lines. Look around for buildings, fences, or other valuable plants. If any of these are in the fall path, or too close for comfort, hire a professional. * **Wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): ** This is non-negotiable.

At a minimum, you'll need: * Safety glasses or a face shield * Work gloves * Long pants and long-sleeved shirt * Sturdy, closed-toe boots (steel-toed if possible) * Hearing protection (especially if using a chainsaw)

##  Step 2: Cut Down the Tree

The method for felling a small tree involves two main cuts: a "notch" (or "hinge") cut and a "felling" cut. This creates a hinge that [guides](https://pestpolicy.com/10-trees-to-grow-in-containers/)the [tree](https://pestpolicy.com/can-i-plant-trees-and-shrubs-in-late-fall-or-winter/)'sfall.

1. **Make the Notch Cut (Directional Cut): ** * This cut determines the direction the tree will fall. It should be made on the side of the tree facing your desired fall direction. * **First Cut (Top of Notch): ** Make a downward-sloping cut into the trunk, going about one-third of the way through the trunk's diameter. Aim for a 45-degree angle.

* **Second Cut (Bottom of Notch): ** Make a horizontal cut from the other side, meeting the first cut precisely to create a wedge-shaped notch.

Remove the wedge of wood. 2. **Make the Felling Cut (Back Cut): ** * Move to the opposite side of the tree from your notch. * Make a horizontal cut about 2. 5-5 cm (1-2 inches) *above* the bottom of your notch cut. * As you cut, the tree should begin to lean and eventually fall. If it doesn't, you can use a felling wedge or a small pry bar inserted into the back cut to help guide it. * **Important: ** Do not cut all the way through!

Leave a small section of uncut wood (the "hinge") between your notch and felling cut. This hinge is crucial; it guides the tree's fall and prevents it from kicking back towards you. 3. **Retreat Safely: ** As the tree begins to fall, immediately retreat along your pre-planned escape route, keeping your eyes on the falling tree. 4.

**Limb and Buck: ** Once the tree is on the ground, carefully remove the branches ("limbing") and cut the trunk into manageable sections ("bucking") for disposal or firewood. Start limbing from the base of the tree towards the top, working on the side opposite from where the branches are under tension.

##  Step 3: Remove the Stump and Roots

Removing the stump and roots prevents regrowth and clears the area completely.

* **Stump Grinding (Recommended for larger stumps): ** If you can rent a stump grinder, this is the most efficient method. Grind the stump down to below ground level (15-30 cm / 6-12 inches) to allow for planting grass or new plants. * **Chemical Stump Remover: ** Drill several deep holes into the stump, then fill them with a chemical stump remover (usually potassium nitrate). This accelerates decay over several months.

This method is slow but requires minimal effort.

* **Manual Removal (for very small stumps/roots): ** For a very small stump (less than 10 cm / 4 inches diameter), you might be able to dig it out. 1. **Dig a Trench: ** Dig a trench around the stump, exposing the main roots. 2. **Cut Roots: ** Use an axe, loppers, or a root saw to cut through the roots as you expose them. 3. **Leverage Out: ** Once most roots are severed, you may be able to rock the stump loose and pull it out.

* **Natural Decomposition: ** If the stump isn't in the way, you can leave it to decompose naturally. This can take years, but it's cost-free and provides habitat for some organisms. You can accelerate this by drilling holes and keeping them moist or inoculating with mushroom spores.

* **Removing Remaining Roots: ** For some trees, especially those known to sucker (e. g. , Poplar, Willow, some fruit trees), you may need to dig out or treat remaining root sections to prevent new shoots from emerging.

##  Tools Needed to Remove a Small Tree

Having the right tools makes the job safer and more efficient.

* **Cutting Tools: ** * **Hand Saw: ** For very small trees (trunk under 5 cm / 2 inches). * **Bow Saw: ** For trunks up to 10 cm (4 inches). * **Chainsaw: ** For trunks $10-15$ cm (4-6 inches). **Only use if you are experienced and comfortable with chainsaws. ** Renting one might be an option. * **Axe: ** For rough cutting, especially on roots, or for splitting wood. * **Digging Tools: ** * **Shovel: ** For digging around the stump and roots.

* **Mattock or Pickaxe: ** For breaking up compacted soil and cutting through tough roots. * **Root Saw: ** A specialized saw for cutting through underground roots.

* **Safety Gear: ** * Safety glasses/face shield * Work gloves * Hearing protection (for chainsaw) * Sturdy boots * **Other: ** * Felling wedges and a mallet (if using a chainsaw, to help guide fall) * Rope (to help pull the tree in the desired direction, if needed and safe) * Measuring tape * First-aid kit (always have one on hand)

##  Cost to Remove a Small Tree

While DIY is largely about saving money, there are still some potential costs.

* **DIY Costs: ** * **Tools: ** If you don't own the necessary tools, purchasing them can range from KSh 5, 000 for basic hand tools to KSh 30, 000+ for a good quality chainsaw and accessories. * **Rentals: ** Renting a chainsaw or stump grinder will cost significantly less, perhaps KSh 2, 000 - KSh 8, 000 per day. * **Stump Remover Chemicals: ** KSh 1, 000 - KSh 3, 000.

* **Disposal: ** If you can't use the wood/chips, you might pay a small fee at a local dumping site.

* **Professional Costs (for comparison): ** * In Nairobi, professional removal of a truly "small" tree (under 9 meters / 30 feet tall with a small trunk) might range from **KSh 5, 000 KSh 12, 000**, which often includes hauling away debris and potentially basic stump grinding for a little extra. For the average homeowner, this can be a very reasonable cost for safety and convenience.

##  DIY Vs. Hiring a Pro

Deciding whether to DIY or hire a professional comes down to safety, size, and complexity.

* **DIY (Recommended for): ** * Trees with trunks less than 15 cm (6 inches) in diameter. * Trees located in open areas, far from structures, power lines, and other valuable plants. * Homeowners who are comfortable and experienced with power tools, especially chainsaws. * Situations where cost savings are a primary concern and the risk is genuinely minimal.

* **Hiring a Pro (Recommended for): ** * Trees with trunks larger than 15 cm (6 inches) in diameter.

* Trees close to your home, power lines, fences, or other valuable property. * Diseased, decaying, or storm-damaged trees (unpredictable and dangerous). * Trees with complex branching structures. * If you are uncomfortable using power tools or working with falling hazards. * Any situation where you have *any* doubt about your ability to safely remove the tree.

The cost of professional tree removal, especially for a small tree, is often a worthwhile investment compared to the potential cost of property damage, injury, or even death from a DIY attempt gone wrong.

##  FAQs

**Q: Can I remove a small tree by myself without a chainsaw? ** A: Yes, if the tree is truly small (trunk less than 10 cm / 4 inches), you can use a bow saw or a strong hand saw. It will take more effort but is safer than a chainsaw if you're not experienced with one.

**Q: How long does it take for a stump to rot naturally? ** A: Depending on the tree species, climate, and size, a stump can take anywhere from 5 to 15 years or more to fully decompose naturally. Chemical stump removers can accelerate this process, typically reducing the time to 1-3 years.

**Q: What if the tree falls in the wrong direction? ** A: This is why proper planning is crucial. If the tree starts to fall in an unintended direction during the felling cut, *immediately retreat* to your escape route. Do not try to stop or redirect it. This is a primary reason why DIY removal of anything but the smallest, safest trees is ill-advised.

**Q: Do I need a permit to remove a small tree? ** A: In most residential areas, you typically do not need a permit to remove a small tree from your own property, especially if it's ornamental or a non-native species. However, always check with your local city or county council to be sure, particularly if you live in a conservation area or if the tree is a protected species.

**Q: How do I dispose of the tree after removal? ** A: For small trees, you can often cut branches into manageable pieces for green waste collection. Larger logs can be cut for firewood (if you have a fireplace or someone who wants them) or taken to a local refuse site that accepts yard waste. Some tree service companies will chip smaller branches into mulch that you can use in your garden.
