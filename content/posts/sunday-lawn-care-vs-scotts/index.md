For homeowners looking to cultivate a lush, green lawn without hiring a professional service, the market offers a wide array of do-it-yourself (DIY) solutions. Among the most prominent options are [Sunday](https://pestpolicy.com/sunday-lawn-care-cost/)[Lawn](https://pestpolicy.com/sunday-lawn-care-reviews/) Care and Scotts, two brands that represent different philosophies in the DIY lawn care space.

Scotts is a household name, an established giant in traditional lawn and garden retail, offering a vast range of individual products designed for every lawn need. Their approach typically involves purchasing specific bags of fertilizer, weed killer, or grass seed from a local store as needed.

Sunday Lawn Care, on the other hand, is a newer, direct-to-consumer brand that has gained popularity for its personalized, subscription-based model and focus on natural, "mystery-free" ingredients.

This article will delve into a head-to-head comparison of Sunday and Scotts, examining their costs, service models, product offerings, customer experiences, and availability to help you determine which DIY method is best suited for your lawn and lifestyle.

##  My Take: Sunday Lawn Care Vs. Scotts

At a glance, Sunday Lawn Care and Scotts appeal to different segments of the DIY market. Sunday offers unparalleled convenience and customization through its subscription model, delivering tailored, often natural, liquid products directly to your door. This "set it and forget it" approach with guidance is ideal for those who want simplicity and a more eco-conscious option without extensive research.

Scotts, conversely, provides maximum control and widespread accessibility. You pick and choose exactly what you need from local retailers, leveraging a vast catalog of granular and liquid products that have been trusted by generations of homeowners. This is perfect for the seasoned DIYer who prefers to manage each step individually, or for those who need immediate access to specific products for acute lawn problems.

While Sunday focuses on long-term soil health with natural ingredients, Scotts offers powerful, quick-acting solutions, often using conventional chemicals.

##  Cost: Sunday Vs. Scotts

Comparing the cost of Sunday Lawn Care versus Scotts products involves looking at two different purchasing models.

* **Sunday Lawn Care's Cost Approach: ** Sunday operates on an annual subscription model where prices vary based on your lawn size, geographic location, and chosen plan (e. g. , Basic, Keep & Protect, Grow & Renew). Plans can range from approximately **$120 to $350 per year** for an average lawn, which includes several shipments of liquid nutrients and treatments, often a soil test kit, and a hose-end sprayer.

The value lies in the convenience, customization, and free shipping, effectively bundling multiple products and expert advice into a predictable annual fee. While seemingly a higher upfront cost than a single bag of fertilizer, it covers year-round care and removes guesswork. * **Scotts' Cost Approach: ** Scotts products are sold individually at various retail outlets. This means your cost is entirely dependent on what you purchase and how often.

A bag of Scotts Turf Builder lawn food might cost **$25-$70**, while weed killers or pest control products can range from **$15-$40+** per item. For a comprehensive year-round program (like their 4-Step program), you'd buy 4 separate bags, plus potentially extra products for specific issues like grubs or tough weeds. This la carte model offers flexibility but requires the homeowner to budget for and purchase each product separately.

Over a year, if you're buying multiple products for various issues, the total cost can quickly add up and potentially exceed a Sunday subscription, especially for larger lawns.

**Key takeaway on cost: ** Sunday offers predictable annual pricing with bundled convenience. Scotts offers flexibility to buy only what you need, but total annual costs can vary widely depending on your lawn's needs and how many individual products you purchase.

##  Sunday Vs. Scotts: Plans and Services

Both brands provide solutions for common lawn problems, but their delivery and product philosophy differ significantly.

**Sunday Lawn Care: Plans and Services** Sunday's core offering is its "Smart Lawn Plan, " a customized subscription service:

* **Personalized Plan: ** Based on an initial online quiz about your lawn's characteristics (size, sun exposure, grass type, issues) and typically a mail-in soil test (included in the first box), Sunday creates a unique plan.

* **Liquid Nutrient Pouches: ** The primary products are liquid fertilizers with ingredients like seaweed, molasses, humic acid, and often natural sources of N-P-K (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium), designed for hose-end sprayer application.

* **Targeted Treatments: ** Plans can include liquid weed control (e. g. , Dandelion Doom with iron, Weed Warrior), and pest control (e. g. , Mosquito Deleto, Nix Ticks) which often utilize plant-derived or naturally occurring active ingredients. * **Grass Seed & Soil Amendments: ** Some plans include specialty grass seeds for bare spots or specific grass types, and additional soil boosters.

* **Seasonal Shipments: ** Products are shipped directly to your door at the optimal time for application throughout your growing season (e. g. , 3-5 boxes per year). * **Support: ** Access to online resources and "lawn advisors" for guidance.

Sunday emphasizes user-friendliness, reducing chemical use, and long-term soil health.

**Scotts: Plans and Services** Scotts offers a vast catalog of individual products, often organized around a multi-step seasonal approach:

* **Scotts 4-Step Program: ** This is Scotts' most popular structured program, consisting of four granular products to be applied seasonally: * **Step 1 (Early Spring): ** Crabgrass preventer plus lawn food. * **Step 2 (Late Spring): ** Weed control (broadleaf) plus lawn food. * **Step 3 (Summer): ** Lawn food with additional nutrients to withstand heat and drought.

* **Step 4 (Fall): ** Winterizer lawn food to strengthen roots for winter and promote spring green-up.

* **Individual Fertilizers: ** Numerous formulations like Scotts Turf Builder (various N-P-K ratios), Triple Action (weed, feed, and strengthen), and Green Max (iron-rich for quick greening). * **Weed Control: ** A wide range of granular and liquid weed killers for specific weeds (e. g. , Weed B Gon for broadleaf, Halts for crabgrass).

* **Pest Control: ** Solutions for grubs (GrubEx), surface insects (Turf Builder with insect control), and specific pests like fire ants.

* **Grass Seed: ** A comprehensive selection of grass seed mixes (e. g. , Turf Builder Grass Seed, EZ Seed) for different climates and light conditions. * **Soil Amendments: ** Products like gypsum, lawn soil, and topsoil. * **Application Tools: ** Scotts also manufactures a full line of spreaders (broadcast and drop) and sprayers.

Scotts' strength is its extensive product line allowing for highly targeted treatments and its conventional formulas often provide quicker, more aggressive results for common issues.
