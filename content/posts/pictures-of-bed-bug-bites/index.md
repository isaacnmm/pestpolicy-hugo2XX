The bites are usually found on the body parts that are exposed to the bed bugs while you sleep. These could be the neck, hands, shoulders, legs, arms, and face. Though not the usual case, bed bug bites are usually found in small groups.

In the bitten area, they might be linear or in the form of a zigzag. If you see small, raised, or flat spots that might become itchily inflamed or blistered, then you might be a victim of a bed bug bite. The type and time of reaction depend on the type of skin and the number of bites from the insects. Some people get skin reactions long after the bites, while some call it almost immediately.

The fact is that reactions dont occur immediately you receive a bite.

It could take from a few minutes to one week. This is also the time that your body starts to manifest the bite symptoms. When they pierce the skin to suck blood, bed bugs inject with their saliva, an anti-coagulant. Related: Pictures of Bed Bugs.

##  Symptoms of Bed Bug Bite-Bite Identification

Compared to bites of other insects, the bed bug bites will always appear in grouped, small red marks on the areas that have been bitten. In the beginning, the victim will encounter a slight burning sensation.

This is followed by itchiness, and then the area might turn red and or swell slightly.

The duration for the symptoms to appear varies among individuals. The red bumps formed after the bites are known as wheals or papules. If the biting was extreme, the swellings might turn into skin inflammations that look like blisters.
