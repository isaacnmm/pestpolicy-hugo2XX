## Buying Guide for 5
- Inch Gutter Guards
Choosing the best gutter guard for your 5
- inch gutters involves balancing performance, durability, cost, and installation preferences.
### 1. Debris Type and Volume in Your Area
* **Fine Debris (Pine Needles, Shingle Grit, Seeds):** If you have many conifer trees or your roof sheds a lot of grit, a **micro
- mesh** system (LeafFilter, HomeCraft, All American, MasterShield, Raptor) is highly recommended. This will provide the most thorough protection. * **Large Leaves and Twigs:** If large leaves are your primary concern, simpler screens (though not listed as top 6, still an option) or **brush guards (GutterBrush)** can be effective and more affordable.
However, they are less effective against fine debris.
### 2. Material Quality and Durability
* **Metal (Aluminum, Stainless Steel):** These are the gold standard. Aluminum frames provide lightweight strength and corrosion resistance, while stainless steel micro
- mesh offers superior filtration and longevity. They resist warping, cracking, and UV degradation. * **Avoid Flimsy Plastics:** While cheap, basic plastic screens can become brittle and crack over time, offering minimal long
- term protection.
### 3. Installation Method: Professional vs. DIY
* **Professional Installation:** Brands like LeafFilter, HomeCraft, All American, and MasterShield offer comprehensive services. This includes cleaning your gutters, making minor repairs, and securely installing their system. This option provides maximum peace of mind with robust warranties (often covering labor and performance) and is ideal for multi
- story homes or homeowners who prefer a hands
- off approach.
* **DIY Installation:** Products like Raptor and GutterBrush are designed for homeowner installation. This significantly reduces costs. If you choose DIY, ensure you are comfortable and safe working on a ladder and follow all manufacturer instructions meticulously to ensure effectiveness and avoid voiding product warranties.
### 4. Water Handling Capacity
* A high
- quality gutter guard must be able to handle extreme rainfall without causing water to "overshoot" the gutters. Micro
- mesh systems generally excel at this, provided their surface remains relatively clear.
### 5. Warranty and Guarantees
* A **strong warranty** is crucial for long
- term investment. Look for: * **Lifetime Warranty:** Indicates a product built to last. * **Transferable Warranty:** Adds value if you sell your home. * **"No
- Clog" Guarantee:** This is paramount, ensuring your gutters will remain free of blockages. Some professional companies will service your gutters if they do clog.
### 6. Aesthetic Impact
* Consider how the gutter guards will look on your home. Most micro
- mesh systems are designed to be low
- profile and blend in. Some brands offer color choices for their frames to match your existing gutters or trim.
