##  Step-by-Step - How to Get Rid Of Fleas in the House Forever

###  Step 1: Flea-Treat the Dog

Fleas are tiny, wingless insects that live in the fur of animals like dogs and cats. One of the best ways to rid your dog of fleas is with flea shampoo. - After a bath, take the time to work down his or her legs and under their armpits at which point you will have rinsed away any fleas that are left behind.

Rinse the pet to flash down the fleas into the drain - maybe it'll require another washing - also check these [drain cleaners](https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//).

For your dogs safety, it is necessary for you to either apply Advantage or Frontline flea prevention between the pet's shoulder blades.

You may need to reapply for this monthly product for three months, in order to keep fleas under control in the house and yard. - The most common way to treat a dog with flea-infested is by using topical treatments such as fipronil, permethrin, or selamectin After applying the treatment, it will take around 24 hours for all of the fleas on your pet's body to die. However, this does not mean they're gone forever!

- The fleas may return after some time has passed if you don't maintain regular housecleaning routines which include vacuuming carpets regularly and washing bedding weekly. Remove and flea-treat all bedding from your dog's crate or kennel as well as furniture items that have come into contact with them (couches, chairs). - This includes blankets of any kind including pillows and stuffed animals.

Anything left may carry live eggs which could hatch before being noticed later when new laundry comes out to air dry. Vacuum carpets thoroughly at least twice using a vacuum cleaner with a beater bar attachment.

Sprinkle borax every two feet on the carpet and let it sit for 12-24 hours to kill any remaining flea eggs that may have been missed in your first vacuuming session. - Vacuum up all of the borax after 24 hours have passed, or when you leave the house.

###  Step 2: Flea-treat the Yard

If you have a yard, the environment your Flea-Treat the Dog lives in can be an infestation point. The best thing to do is get out there and Flea-treat it! - You're going to need some water, a hose or garden sprayer, dish soap (optional), cayenne pepper, and baking soda. More importantly than anything else - patience. Flea-treat the yard. Experts recommend using flea and flea-eggs to control pesticides to treat your lawn and common areas.

Spray where the dog walks, and at any other places, it frequents outside.

To create a yard free of harmful fleas, homeowners have many other treatment options.

Wondercide will kill fleas and other household pests (ants, spiders, and cockroaches) in your yard, but you need to apply it more than once every few months.

Wondercide is a safe and effective insect repellent that can be applied as needed. It has numerous uses, such as for flea-treating the yard, or preventing pests at home.

###  Step 3: Flea-treat the House

First, you ask, how do I get rid of fleas in my house fast? - Be sure your home is clean and vacuum all carpets, pet hair, and upholstery. - Treat fleas with a preventative product or liquid insecticide. Be sure the treated areas are not over-saturated so as to avoid the risk of fire hazards. - Remove reservoir hosts from your yard (grasses, leaves) which serve as food sources for flea larvae - and the wholeflea life stages.

If you want a long-term solution to killing fleas, then its best to use pesticides inside your home.

Vacuum your house thoroughly before going on to the next step - vacuum all crevices and corners.

Once you have vacuumed the carpet, be sure to throw out your vacuum bag. - Pets must be removed from the premises for at least 2 - 3 hours before and during house and yard treatment. Steam clean the pet beds, upholstery, and [carpets. ](https://pestpolicy.com/getting-rid-of-fleas-in-the-carpet/)Do the laundry. Wash all bedding in hot water and dry on high heat for at least 20 minutes. - Vacuum or sweep floors, including under furniture.

Throw out any vacuum bag contents as fleas could survive in them for up to a year if they get stuck inside it Clean your pet's bowls, litter box, food dishes with soapy dish detergent and rinse well- then scrub clean with a bleach solution of one tablespoon bleach per quart of warm water (or use commercial products designed to kill flea larvae).

- Immediately throw away stuffed animals that cannot be washed because their stuffing can harbor flea eggs and pupae alive; seal cracks where pets might have been living or hiding indoors such as along baseboards; Launder infrequently used bedding and other household fabrics in hot water.

###  Step 4: Use Flea IGRs and Flea Bombs

Spray the flea pesticide in the house. Once youve applied the pesticide, it's time to deploy one or more flea bombs in your home. - Effective pest control for every room of the house and garage is a must. You can place them on newspapers or rolls of paper towels to make cleanup easy after their detonation! How to use Flea bombs:

- Place the flea bomb in a safe space where pets and children are not likely to get into it, such as on top of a dresser or under furniture.

- Keep people and animals out of the room for 4 hours after setting off the flea bomb.

- Pets can re-enter 4 hours later but should be monitored closely during this time period because they may have been exposed to harmful chemicals from the fog created by using a flea bomb. - Apply liquidflea killers with IGRson crevices, cracks, and carpet - this will hinder flea larvae development.

- Also, you can sprayflea-killing powderssuch as Fleabusters that'll fully cut down the flea life cycle in 4 - 6 weeks - Leave windows open so that air is able to circulate without any obstruction throughout your home afterward.

- Use an air purifier if possible; this will help remove any lingering chemical residue left behind by the bombs which could cause respiratory issues with dogs.

To rid your house of fleas, you will need to vacuum the floors and shampoo the carpets. Repeating these tasks monthly for 3 months is necessary in order to fully eradicate the pests from your home.

###  Step 5: Diatomaceous earth and borax for fleas

No one likes fleas. They are annoying and spread diseases from person to pet, animal to animal, sometimes even across the country but diatomaceous earth and borax can help. - Especially in hot climates like Florida, where I live with my family during the summers, we're constantly combating them as they seem to come out of nowhere when you least expect it.

Diatomaceous earth is a natural product made up of fossilized remains of diatoms - microscopic algae-like organisms found on our planet since prehistoric times (it's also known as DAP). - It can be purchased at feed stores or online for use against pests such as bedbugs and most types of roaches. One application will kill all bugs present on contact alone; no need for any other pesticide or chemical.

Borax is also a natural mineral, mined from the earth in compounds that make it safe for use around pets and children.

It's commonly used as an insecticide because roaches are especially susceptible to its toxic properties - meaning one application typically takes care of all types of pest bugs at once without any need for follow-up applications. - The big takeaway: Diatomaceous earth and borax can be combined together to combat fleas with ease!
