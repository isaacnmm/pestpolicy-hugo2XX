For homeowners in Dallas and across North Texas, dealing with fire ants is a constant and painful reality. A single misstep in your own lawn can lead to dozens of agonizing stings. When a fire ant mound appears, it demands a quick and decisive response.

Simply spraying the top of the mound is a recipe for failure. **The only effective way to eliminate a fire ant colony is to use a product that is carried back into the mound to kill the queen.** If the queen survives, the colony will either recover or simply relocate a few feet away. This professional guide outlines the field-tested, two-step method recommended by Texas A&M AgriLife Extension for achieving total control.

### The "Why": Understanding the Fire Ant Colony

The fluffy mound of soil you see on your lawn is just the tip of the iceberg. It's the entrance to a sprawling underground colony that can be several feet deep and house up to 200,000 workers. The entire colony is dedicated to a single purpose: protecting and feeding the queen, who can lay over 1,000 eggs per day. Your treatment must be designed to reach and kill her.

### The Field-Tested Elimination Plan: The Two-Step Method

This is the gold standard for fire ant control. It combines a broad, preventative treatment with a targeted attack on existing mounds.

#### Step 1: Broadcast a Fire Ant Bait (The Long-Term Prevention)

This is the most important step for lasting control and should be done twice a year, once in the spring and again in the fall.

*   **What it is:** A fire ant bait is a slow-acting insecticide mixed with a food attractant (often processed corn grits coated in soybean oil).
*   **How it Works:** You use a lawn spreader to broadcast the granular bait over your entire yard. Foraging ants find the bait, think it's food, and carry it back to the mound. They feed it to the entire colony, including the queen. This slowly and systematically kills the colony from the inside out over several weeks.
*   **CRITICAL TIMING:** Only apply bait when the ground is dry and no rain is expected for at least 24 hours. The best time is late afternoon when foraging activity is high.

#### Step 2: Treat Individual Mounds (The Immediate Takedown)

For the large, active mounds that are an immediate threat, a direct treatment is necessary.

*   **Use a Mound Drench:** This is the most effective and reliable method. You mix a liquid insecticide concentrate with water in a bucket (according to the label directions) and pour it directly over the center of the mound. You must use enough volume (typically 1-2 gallons) to completely saturate the mound and penetrate deep enough to kill the queen.
*   **Granular Mound Treatments:** These are another good option. You sprinkle a measured amount of the granular insecticide over the top of the mound and then water it in, which activates the product and carries it down into the colony.

### Common Mistakes Dallas Homeowners Make

*   **Using Gasoline or Boiling Water:** These are dangerous, ineffective, and environmentally harmful myths. They will kill the ants on the surface but will almost never penetrate deep enough to kill the queen. The survivors will simply relocate.
*   **Disturbing the Mound Before Treatment:** Do not kick or rake the mound before you treat it. This will cause the ants to panic and they may move the queen to a safer location, either deeper underground or to a satellite mound, making your treatment ineffective.
*   **Spraying the Top with a Hose-End Sprayer:** This is a waste of product. It kills the surface workers but, like the myths above, does not reach the queen.

### FAQ

**Q: I treated a mound, and a new one popped up a few feet away. What happened?**
A: This is a classic sign that your initial treatment failed to kill the queen. The surviving workers likely moved her through their underground tunnels to establish a new exit. This is why using a sufficient volume of a liquid drench is so important—it ensures the entire central cavity of the nest is saturated.

**Q: When is the best time of year to apply a broadcast bait in the Dallas area?**
A: The optimal times are when the fire ants are most actively foraging. For North Texas, this is typically in May/June and again in September/October. A good rule of thumb is to apply bait when soil temperatures are between 70°F and 95°F.

**Q: Are these treatments safe for my kids and pets?**
A: When used exactly according to the product label directions, they are safe. For broadcast baits, the amount of active ingredient is incredibly small. For mound drenches, the area should be kept clear of people and pets until the liquid has completely dried. The product label is the law and will provide all the specific safety information you need.
