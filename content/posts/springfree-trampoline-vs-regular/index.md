###  What Is A Springfree Trampoline?

A [Springfree Trampoline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfree_Trampoline)is simply a trampoline without springs. These trampolines dont have springs in their construction, instead they are reinforced with fiberglass poles. Hence, they eliminate areas that can trap the toes or feet or those areas that can cause pinching.

Developed by [Dr. Keith Vivian Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Alexander_(engineer)),springfree trampolines have hidden frames. These frames have 3 layers of rust protection to prevent peeling. The frame is also located beneath the jumping surface. Hence, theres no way a jumper can hit it or fall on it.

Dr. Keith Vivian created safe trampolines by eliminating all areas on a regular trampoline that cause injuries. Thus, he eliminated steel coil springs and the rigid perimeter frame to come with the safest trampolines of our time.

The Springfree Trampolines also feature a SoftEdge mat that provides 30 times more shock absorption than regular pads. This mat also eliminates all the hard edges on the jumping area to make it injury-free for the user

The springfree also comes with an enclosure net that helps to cushion wayward jumpers and protect them from falling to the ground. The structure feature flexible enclosure rods that reinforce the safety net eliminating the need for metal poles

###  What Is a Regular Trampoline?

Regular trampolines commonly known as Spring-based trampolines use springs to reinforce the structure. The springs can pinch or injure the user. Hence, they are not as safe as the springfree trampolines.

However, the Regular Trampoline are more affordable and their spare parts are easily accessible. They also come in different shapes including oval, rectangle, and round. All of these shapes provide a different experience in terms of the bounce.

Regular Trampolines also have exposed frames that make the jumping surface hard. Hence, a jumper may get serious injuries and fractures.

Unlike the SoftEdge mat in springfee trampoline that provides good shock absorption, the pads in regular trampoline do not provide as much shock absorption. Thus, a jumper is likely to get injuries while jumping on a regular trampoline. These pads also have a short life span.

Both the Springfree Trampoline and Regular trampoline come with enclosure net. These nets are crucial at enhancing the overall safety of the trampoline user.

These nets prevent unintended trampoline falls that may result in life threatening injuries like broken bones. Both the Springfree Trampoline and Regular trampoline have tightly woven nets.

The only difference is that regular trampoline use steel poles to reinforce the net. However, Springfree felt that the traditional trampoline was not safe enough so they made their enclosure net more flexible. Thus, in springfree youll not find any steel poles.

###  Springs

A regular trampoline features steel coil springs while the springree features glass-reinforced rods that are located below the edges of the jumping mat.

Most people agree that springfree trampolines provides smooth, non-jarring bounce thats gentle to the joints and knees of the jumper. On the other hand, some people argue that the regular trampoline gives a better bounce because of the coil springs, which helps in increasing the bounce.

Overall, we can say that both the Springfree Trampoline and Regular trampoline have a comparable bounce.

This patented design of the springfree ensures the users safety while jumping.

On the other hand, the frame on the regular or traditional trampoline is visible. To make the frame more durable, most regular trampolines now feature a galvanizing technology that enhances the overall safety of the net pole and the frame.

##  Why Are Springfree Trampolines Safer Than Regular Trampolines**?**

The design of Springfree Trampoline makes it safer than traditional trampoline. The fact that its springless and cant pinch or injure the user makes it a number one choice for many.

Other than that, the frame on springfree trampoline is underneath the mat and the jumper cant hit it, thus, eliminates chances of injuries.

However, spring-based or the regular trampolines are hazardous to jumpers and they can cause life threatening injuries like fractures on the legs, hands, or joints. A jumper can also get serious head injuries.

Springfree Trampoline are also Safer because of the SoftEdge mat that provides 30 times more shock absorbency than the pads used in regular trampolines.

##  Are Springfree Trampolines Worth The Money?

I would say yes. Springfree trampolines are worth the money. They deliver a better bounce, have excellent safety features, and they have many positive buyer reviews.

However, springfree trampolines are more expensive than the regular trampolines. The springfree are double or triple the price of a traditional trampoline.

###  2. Ensure You Have an Even Ground Level

Further, you should set up the trampoline in a place with no fences, trees, or anything that can cause injuries as one jumps.

###  3. Ensure the Trampoline Is Clear Of Any Objects

Its crucial that you always check beneath the trampoline to ensure that no object is underneath. The trampoline should be visible in all directions or from all angles. This allows you to spot anything that could be below or inside the trampoline and remove immediately.

Your children may put things below the trampoline that may cause them harm when jumping. Also encourage your children to avoid going underneath the trampoline.

###  4. Do Regular Inspection

Regular trampoline inspection will ensure your children are safe always as they jump. Therefore, on a regular basis before they start jumping you should do a thorough inspection. Check for any structural weakness, sharp edges, tears, and anything that looks unusual.

###  5. Adult Supervision

Adult supervision is critical at all times as children jump on their trampoline. An adult will immediately notice any issue and take any necessary action. He/she can also advice the jumpers on the best ways to use the trampoline to avoid injuries.

###  6. Encourage one Jumper at a Time

Having one-person jump at a time will reduce collision and common injuries. However, if you can closely supervise the kids you can have multiple of them jumping together. The safety of your kids while jumping is your responsibility.
