If you are a granite enthusiast, you can tell of the beauty it brings and the vulnerability it possesses. Thus, I sought the best granite sealers with the possibility of prolonging the durability of this gem.

Though costly, you only need to apply once, and you are good to go. Dry-treat leaves an impermeable surface that allows the surface to breathe and avoids moisture build up on your surface. This is a good attribute as it helps avoid damage to the surface by moisture giving it longer shelf life. Whenever applying this sealer, you will need 2-3 coats to achieve better results that can last your surface for long.
