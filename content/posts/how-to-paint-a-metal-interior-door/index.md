# # Major Problems of Unpainted Metal Interior Door?

Failing to paint your metal interior door may lead to some of the following problems:

## # 1. Rusting

Rusting is commonly known as corrosion or oxidation of the iron metal. Iron metal rusts when exposed to a moisture/humid environment in presence of oxygen. Painting is one method of eliminating rust from metal surfaces. The paint lay prevents water and oxygen (agents of rusting) from getting into contact with the metal surface.

## # 2. Fast Aging

Unpainted metal age faster than painted ones. Usually, the primary metal surface is exposed to external factors such as UV-rays that weakens the structure bonds with continuous exposure. The paint coat protects the surface metal from external harsh conditions and thus boosting the entire service life.

## # 3. Loss of Impressive Outlook

# # Challenges of Poorly Painted Metal Interior Door
