Regular cleaning will keep your equipment functioning smoothly and ensure high-quality results every time.

You can add a small amount of soap if necessary to break down paint residue.

- **Oil-Based Paints: **For oil-based paints, you will need a solvent-based cleaner, such as mineral spirits or paint thinner.

These solutions dissolve the oil-based paint and allow you to easily clean the components. - **Specialized Paint Sprayer Cleaner: **Many manufacturers offer specific cleaning products designed for their airless sprayers. These cleaners are formulated to work effectively with their equipment and help remove stubborn paint residue.
