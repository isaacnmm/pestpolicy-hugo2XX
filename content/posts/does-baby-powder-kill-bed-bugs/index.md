Carbon dioxide is produced - when the dry ice starts melting - willattract the bed bugs. 5. The talcum in the baby powder will make the bloodsuckers slide and thus won't escape. 6. So, place the bed bugs trap near areaswhere bed bugs hide- including upholstery, couches, cushions, crevices, and cracks.
