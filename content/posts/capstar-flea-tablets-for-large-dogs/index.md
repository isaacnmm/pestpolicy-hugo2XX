##  Are Capstar flea tablets safe for nursing or pregnant dogs?

During the flea treatment process, you may notice that the dog may start itching and scratching - this is when the fleas are dying. Itching and scratching in dogs after giving them the Capstar flea tablets is a temporary reaction to the movement of fleas. - Cats can show some temporary signs like excessive grooming, vocalization, panting, and hyperactivity.

You can prevent miliary dermatitis and flea allergy dermatitis (FAD) in dogs by treating the pets using Capstar flea tablets.

Also, you can use Capstar tablets in conjunction with other medications including shampoos, deworming medications, vaccines, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and heartworm preventives. Remember that fleas also spread tapeworms and so controlling these products will have extensive medical benefits to your dog. Capstar tablets will however not kill the fleas that are in and around the house ( the pets' environment ).

- So, repeat the flea treatment on the dog using Capstar tablets since the immature fleas in the environment will develop into mature ladies attacking your large dogs again. So, in addition to using the Capstar tablet to exterminate the adult fleas, you can use an insect growth inhibitor such as program flavor to help control fleas in the other life stages.

##  Fleas life cycle

Fleas are known to be fast producers and so their presence can cause a major problem to your pets and the household in general. - For example, 1 female flea willlay about 2000+ eggsbefore it dies. These eggs will develop and hatch to become adults in about 3 weeks. Next, once the female fleas have their blood meal from the pets, they will go ahead and lay more eggs.

- The flea larvae will emerge from the flea eggs in a few days and will remain in the pet's environment concealed in places such as the pet bedding and the carpet. Next, the flea larvae will create a cocoon and wait for appropriate stimuli so that they can emerge as young adult fleas. The fleas in the stage will next hitchhike your pet and continue feeding on their blood - growth further to the flea cycle.

- So, effectively control the fleas in all the life stages, we recommend a combination of the Capstar tablets (nitenpyram) and the flavor tablets (lufenuron).

##  Capstar (nitenpyram) for Large Dogs

The oral tablets (Capstar) will exterminate adult fleas in large dogs, cats, puppies, and kittens that are 4 + weeks old and whose weight is 2 + pounds.

##  A Recent Customer Review

The customer notes that he hit the research grounds for an effective flea killer recently. - But he is keen to caution that Capstar tablets are our only guide for killing adult fleas on large dogs. It is therefore impossible to use Capstar tablets to target fleas that are in the environment. - But the customer states that the Capstar flea tablets are an excellent tool that you can incorporate into the flea control mission.

So, if you're planning to utilize mostly or only cut the tablets to control fleas in the house and on the dog, you will require extra vigilance and keen knowledge of the flea cycle. - This would require that you give the large dogs these Capstar flea tablets for a long time - this would require a vet's advice.
