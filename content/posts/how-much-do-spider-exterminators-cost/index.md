# # When to Hire a Professional Spider Exterminator

Maybe you've seen a single or few spiders around and you're wondering is it time I called the exterminator?

Well, it's important to know the type and number of spiders that you can handle along and when you need to make that call to your exterminator for help with spider control. **Hire a Spider Exterminator? ** If you can observe the spider and figure out which type it is - harmless or poisonous, then it'll be easy to determine if you should call the exterminator.

If it's just an average, harmless spider in the house then there is no need for any help at all from pest control specialists. - Luckily, the market hasspider trapsand catchers that enable spider control without touching or coming near the bug. A spider catcher is a tool that is used for catching and releasing spiders. - A spider catcher usually consists of a long pole with a loop at the end, which can be either an open or closed hoop.

The very tip of this rod has soft bristles - what's called "the hook". As soon as you see any type of spider crawling on your wall, in front of windows, etc. , simply flick it out using the hooked part to release it outside from where it came from! - These tools will save you all types of panic attacks and stress from spider attacks In this video, exterminator Jim Triggs provides some tips on how to kill spiders at home using a spider catcher.

Well, a number of factors are important to consider in deciding whether or not you should contact an exterminator. But, before reaching out to a pest control company, take a look at 1. What the company can do for you, and 2. If this type of problem is within their scope.

# # So, How Much Do Spider Exterminators Cost?

That depends on a number of factors.

Every company has its own pricing structure that may not be clear upfront, which means you need to take time and research prices before committing to anything.

And even then, there's no guarantee what your actual budget will end up being because rates vary by the city! - You also have other factors like how many treatments they offer per year as well as if they provide any type of warranty or guarantees with the service. - Some companies offer monthly packages so make sure you find out this information ahead of time so you know what your total investment will be long-term versus **1.

Cost of a Reactive Spider Treatment** Reactive treatment to control spiders inside your home can cost anywhere from $100 - $300. This will generally just get rid of any recent, active spiders in the house. - In reactive treatment, exterminators will spray pesticide in areas such as inside baseboards, ceilings, and the crawl spaces around your house.

It's not likely to offer any long-term protection from future infestations because it doesn't get rid of anything outside (in the yard or on neighboring properties) and it won't protect against more spiders coming into your house in the near future.

## # 2. Preventive Spider Treatment

Preventive spider treatmentwill cost you anywhere from $500 - $1, 000, but it can offer a lot more protection.

In this type of treatment, an exterminator will spray pesticide outside your house and on neighboring properties to deal with any spiders that could come in. - They'll also seal up the exterior cracks or gaps around your house so those spiders won't be able to get inside either. - This will involve spraying the outdoor-facing areas like various entry points, eaves, door frames, and windows to prevent a spider invasion.

One approach in preventive treatment is to set up a contract with an exterminator who will visit your property quarterly, annually, or both.

# # Information to give the Exterminator for Spiders

Working together, the exterminator and you can effectively get rid of spider infestations inside your spaces - office, yard, or home.

Before you call an exterminator, make sure to know what kind of information they'll need.

## # 1. Spider Species in Question?

The type of spider in question can affect the extermination measures, so it's important to tell your exterminator the specific spider they will be working with.

You can provide the exterminator with a call describing what types of spiders are present as well as their general physical characteristics.

- Among the most common arachnids found in homes are funnel web, [**jumping**](https: //entomology. ca. uky. edu/spider-chart), [**yellow sac**](http: //entomology. wsu. edu/outreach/bug-info/yellow-sac-spider/), [**cellar spider**](https: //extension. psu. edu/longbodied-cellar-spider), [**brown recluse**](http: //ento. psu. edu/extension/factsheets/brown-recluse-spiders), and[**black widow**](https: //texasinsects. tamu.

edu/southern-black-widow-spider/).

## # 2. Spider Location

Gathering information about the spiders' location will ensure that your exterminator is better prepared for effective treatment.

The exterminator will need to know the specifics of your home or space, such as the spider-infested areas. This will allow them to begin work without wasting time studying coverage areas.

It is important to call your pest control company as soon as you see any evidence that there is a spider problem in your home. - One way to identify this is seeing webbing anywhere from corners up the walls and in dark spaces like under cabinets, crawl space, or the attic. - Also, check webbing around windowsills, near hanging indoor plants, or behind curtains on window frames that extend floor-to-ceiling.

## # 3. Duration of the Spider Infestation

A spider infestation can be short or long in duration.

If the spiders are only coming inside your home during rainy periods, it might just be a temporary issue with an open window which should clear up when the weather changes. - But their webbing keeps increasing over time, then this indicates that professional intervention may need to happen sooner rather than later. At the time of service, you will have to answer questions about the first spider sighting.

This will allow the exterminator to assess the severity of the spider infestation.

## # 4. Recurring Spiderwebs

If you have been seeing evidence of spider webs for more than six months and there is no reason why they would come indoors (or go outdoors).

Spiders will spin webs periodically, but they are usually only in one place for a short time.

A recurring spiderweb can be an indication that there is a nest of spiders nearby and the web is their hunting ground. - The webs will get bigger or recur as more spiders come to feed on prey (i. e. , you) until it gets so big that the structure collapses or washes away with rainwater. This would be especially true if your house has another pest, such as insects or rodents which could attract spiders.

If this happens contact exterminators who specialize in removing these pests from homes even before they cause any damage!

## # 5. Any Spider Eggs Seen?

If you spot spider eggs in your home, it's a sign that you have spiders. Spider mothers can lay up to 100 eggs at one time and they will hatch within two weeks of being laid.

Spider eggs are a sign that you have spiders, and if they hatch before extermination is done then it will cause more problems for your home.

So, let the exterminator know if you've seen spider eggs, and don't spray insecticides indoors without first asking for the exterminator's permission. - You may notice egg sacs that are woven on the ceiling or wall, on leaves of any indoor plant, or under the spiderweb inside the corners of a room. When you notice a number of egg sacs laying around in different corners of the rooms, it is possible an infestation has already begun.

# # What to Ask the Spider Exterminator

When it comes to getting rid of spiders, finding the right exterminator matters.

To find out if youve found the right one, ask them these critical questions. - How often should I expect an exterminator to come? - What are your methods of extermination for spiders and other bugs? - What is the procedure for spider removal from inside walls, ceilings, or window screens? - Would you be picking up any furniture that needs to be sprayed with insecticide?

## # 1. Licenses and Credentials

Certifications and credentials are important, but also only tell one part of the story.

Be sure to ask what licenses they hold instead, especially if you live in a state with specific laws about pest control (like California).

What kind of entomology certification do they have? If there is no response given by the company about their qualifications, it could mean that either: - The person doesn't know because he has never been asked before - They're too busy trying to get your business - There's something fishy When looking for the right company to handle your spider infestation, it's important that you ask about their qualifications.

You want written proof of their certifications, licenses, and registration. Ask for these documents before hiring the extermination company.

## # 2. References

What are former customers saying about the services the spider extermination company offers? - Also, ask them how long have they been in business, and how many customers do they serve on a regular basis? Check the competence of the company by asking previous clients about their experience. - Reliable exterminator review websites such as Angie's List and HomeAdvisor can help you find a qualified specialist in your region.

Interview the past clients on the quality of service that the exterminator provided - especially on spider control.

## # 2. Extermination Methods and Chemicals

Ask the exterminator about their methods of spider elimination. Do they use environmentally safe chemicals? - For example, spider control mainly uses[**pyrethrin**](http: //npic. orst. edu/factsheets/pyrethrins. html)as the key ingredient since it kills the bugs on contact. Barrier treatments, such as those using synthetic [**pyrethroids**](https: //citybugs. tamu. edu/factsheets/ipm/ent-6003/) can offer additional protection.

It is important to know what chemicals will be used by the exterminator in treatment before any chemicals are applied to your spaces.

Spider control can be achieved by using environmentally safe chemicals. - This method is best for sensitive areas such as schools and hospitals, or in homes with pets and children.

## # **3. Spider Control Guarantees**

As a homeowner, you want to know that the problems with your spider infestation are going to be treated properly and effectively.

The best way to know for certain that your spider infestation is under control is with a guarantee. - Spider Control Guarantees to ensure you don't have any more spiders or be able to come back and treat the problem at no additional charge if they do return. Many companies offer their clients guarantees, but there are many other factors to consider before selecting which company's services will work best for you.

- Some of these considerations include price, length of the service contract, whether it includes maintenance agreements, and what type of chemicals they use in treatment. Most companies offer a money-back guarantee and limited reapplication, but the duration of the warranty may differ.

## # 3. How many Treatments are Required?

To get rid of spiders in your home, you will need to do a few treatments.

The number of spider treatments will depend on how bad the problem is with the spiders and how many there are.

Therefore, discuss the number of treatments required on the space after the exterminator conducts the property inspection.

# # How to Handle Pets During Spider Treatment

When spider control treatment is initiated, it's important to know how to keep your pet safe. **1. Isolate Pets to Untreated Rooms ** Spider infestations generally don't involve hundreds of spiders. They will typically only cover a small section of the house.

The pet might need to stay elsewhere during an insect treatment service. - Therefore the exterminator can accommodate them by giving you the choice of a room or two where they will not be applying pesticides - may be in the living room or bedroom. If your pet is not allowed out of the house or if you have a cat, then just try to limit their access to areas where they may come into contact with spider control treatment.

If you let your pets roam around outside and are treating for spiders in the yard, make sure that all windows and doors are closed so no one can get inside without being noticed.

It's also important to keep an eye on any plants around the house because some treatments do affect plant life as well as insects and other pests. - If this is something that concerns you, it will be best to discuss details with someone from the company before services take place. They should be able to give insight on how much exposure there would be during spider control treatment if needed **2.

Lock them in Pet carriers** As this article explains, the kennel is one of the best options for pet owners when dealing with pest control in residences.

Pet owners should consider locking their pets in a kennel when treating pests at home. - Pet carriers are more portable and lighter than traditional cages, making it easier to move your pet from one location to another. Pet carriers will offer short-time refuge for the pets against the spider control chemical but it's required.

- In the event that you have any questions about how to best handle your pets during spider control treatment, we recommend discussing this with someone from the chosen pest control company. They should be able to give insight on how much exposure there would be if needed and provide guidance for ensuring pet safety.

If a kennel is not available or can't be used as an alternative option, it will likely be necessary to lock them inside one of their normal crates while spraying takes place in the vicinity.

# # Steps To Take After the Spider Extermination or Treatment

**1. Continnauly Check for Spiders ** First, once the exterminator is done treating your home for spiders, run a dry inspection to check for spiders that may have survived and report, if any, to the exterminator.

After a spider treatment, it is normal for live spiders to continue dying over the next few days and with less frequency. - Be sure to check indoor areas regularly **2. Don't Clean Immediately** Professional exterminators won't leave a mess on the spider-treated spaces. Thus, you must not mop or clean the spaces and floors immediately.

- While some treatments are applied directly to the baseboards, others come in granular form that can be vacuumed up after application - avoid this as it'll reduce its effectiveness. After your pest control service has treated your home, you are left with an insect carcass or two and messy traps - but don't do a deep cleaning at least for a few days. **3.

Repair any leaks** While looking out for possible survivors, make time to barricade your property against future invaders.

- This can be done by sealing cracks and gaps, minimizing prolonged exposure to the outdoors, and avoiding clutter. Be sure to keep all food in sealed containers if it's not eaten. This will prevent pests from coming in to get their next meal.

Seal up any openings and cracks on the outside of your homes, such as around pipes, doors, or windows.

When painting over these areas use a paint that contains residual insecticide so it'll act as an extra line of defense against unwanted wildlife. If you're not sure whether the new paint is chemical-free, ask for a material safety data sheet (MSDS) before applying it yourself.

If you have gaps smaller than a one-half inch or vents less than 12 square inches then they need to be sealed with steel wool.

# # Should You Alert the Neighbors about the Spider Treatment?

Noticing a spider infestation in your home could mean that you are not on your own!

Homeowners often have a misunderstanding of spiders. On one hand, they only move when it is necessary to do so; yet this doesn't indicate that they cant find their way into better hiding places if needed. - Getting rid of the pests must start at every level: inside and outside the property - including on your neighbor's property and thus you should alert them before the spider treatment.

Watch the video below to see how spiderlings hatch from their egg sacs and migrate.
