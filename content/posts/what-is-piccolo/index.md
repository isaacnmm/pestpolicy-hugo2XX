What is Piccolo? Ive been a flutist for 5 years, but I also play the piccolo. In comparison to the flute, the [piccolo has a higher tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piccolo).

However, the piccolo is much smaller than the flute: being smaller and shorter thus considered a lower instrument. To play piccolo, youll need to add or subtract through lifting our fingers and thats what changes the length of the tube inside and hence alter the notes.
