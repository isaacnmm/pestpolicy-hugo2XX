What is Piccolo? Ive been a flutist for 5 years, but I also play the piccolo. In comparison to the flute, the
[piccolo has a higher tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piccolo)
.

However, the piccolo is much smaller than the flute: being smaller and shorter thus considered a lower instrument.
To play piccolo, youll need to add or subtract through lifting our fingers and thats what changes the length of the tube inside and hence alter the notes.
## What is Piccolo?
In short: Piccolo (pronounced as piccolo) is a woodwind family member and is considered as a half-size flute. The Piccolo in an
[orchestral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestra)
setting is defined as the "piccolo or flute III".
1. Origin of piccolo:Western Europe
2. Family of piccolo:��Aerophone,�Wind instrument,�Woodwinds,Flutes
3. Invention Date:Mid 1800's
4. The close relation toAlto flute, Bass flute, & Flutes - check theseCamera for Music Videos.
But, how would a transition from a flute to the piccolo be? Well, as noted above, the piccolo is practically a smaller flute with the same fingerings but with notes being an octave higher and with a smaller embouchure.

Therefore, initially, it would be challenging to adjust to the piccolos smaller embouchure. However, the piccolos have only the Eb key at its end and thus lacks the C# & C keys.

So, as you add your fingers, youll be pressing down the keys, which closed the keys and hence making longer the tube inside and thus lowering the notes. Read Also:

Further, the piccolo uses wind and not reed. We use the lips to produce a similar type of compression that the reed creates a
