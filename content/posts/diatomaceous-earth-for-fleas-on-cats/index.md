DE comes in various forms, granulated DE, milled DE, and Calcine DE.

Store the DE in dry conditions.

Damp conditions significantly reduce their effectiveness.

##  **Using Diatomaceous Earth for Fleas on Cats**

Besides being used as food for cats, DE is also used to eliminate fleas. The following are the steps to be followed when using DE to eliminate fleas from your cat. **Step 1** Identify the areas your cat likes spending its time the most. Those areas will be the places youll need to focus most when applying DE. Such places could be its favorite couch, the carpet, or even the pillow.

**Step 2** - Vacuum those places where your cat likes to hang out the most.

By this, you will collect any eggs that have not hatched. DE does not affect the eggs and will wait for them to hatch, so it acts. **Step 3** - Sprinkle the areas with DE. Always ensure that the surfaces are dry since damp conditions reduce the effectiveness of DE. You can use an applicator of your choice. Leave the DE on the surfaces for some weeks.

**Step 4-** Let your cat roam around the places you have applied DE for some days and then bathe it.

Ensure that you use a soap-free moisturizing shampoo. **Step 5- ** Chances are the fleas that will not survive the bath, vacuuming, and DE application. Comb your cats fur using a flea comb to ascertain that no flea has been left. Do that for several days. **Step 6-** Vacuum those places you had applied to DE. The recommended vacuum cleaner is the shop vac since DE might ruin the traditional filtered vacuums.

##  **Conclusion**
