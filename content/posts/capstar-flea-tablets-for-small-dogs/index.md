So, Capstar tablets are widely used in rescue operations - for flea-treating stray cats or dogs. - The process involves dosing the cat or dog using Capstar tablets, feeding them appropriately, and then bathing them probably using asuitable flea shampoo.

So, on how long the Capstar flea tablets last, I will say that this is an incorrect or misplaced question because this solution will not offer long-lasting prevention. So, the Capstar tablet may be described as an instant flea solution as opposed to being a long-term flea pill.

##  Are Capstar flea tablets safe for my small dog?

Yes, Capstar tablets are effective in treating fleas on both cats and small dogs. However, you must strictly adhere to the dosage recommendations that are on the product description.

##  Flea-Free Dogs

My mum received the Capstar tablets package in the evening and she administered it immediately. She says that, after 1 hour, she's checked through the dog's hair for any live fleas. - Luckily, not a single live flea was found but there were many dead ones. Next, my mum decided to give a dog a thorough washing to remove most of those dead or live fleas. - Finally, my mum reports that her small dog became flea-free and also happy.

However, she noted that the product description classified the product as non-long-term in its action. - So, she had to contact the vet for accommodation with a longer-term flea killer for a small dog. My mum's review is that Capstar tablets will be great if you need an easy and quick remedy for fleas prior to getting a longer-term remedy.

##  Effective for small dogs

Capstar tablets worked excellently as described. - I used the product on my small dogs that weigh anywhere from 11 lb to 16 pounds. I noticed that the Shitzu dog that had denser hair on its body came with more fleas. But we administered 1 dose to each of the dogs and the formulation was able to clear all the pests within 1 to 2 days. - However, it was important to administer another dose to the dog that had long hair after 1 week.

My review is that Capstar tablets are effective safe and well-priced for use in controlling fleas - plus they are nonprescription which makes them very convenient. Capstar cleared the fleas on my Shih Tzu dog that mainly stays in the US but sometimes moves to the yard - where I believe he picked some fleas. - But ever since this encounter, I also purchased a[yard flea killer](https: //pestpolicy.

##  Used in Conjunction with Flea Combs

Experts recommend that you use the Capstar tablets in conjunction with some quality flea combs. - This will increase the chances of catching all the fleas within one hour. After administering the medication, you will notice that a small dog will begin moving around and becoming restless and scratching crazily. - This is because the fleas will have panicked and so will be moving around as they die from the medication.

Pet owners are advised that this is a common habit but they should comb the outdoors to catch any fleas that may escape.

##  Conclusion

So in summary, Capstar tablets are effective remedies for controlling adult fleas that are already on your small dog. - However, be cautious because there is a dosage limitation depending on the age and weight of your small dog. I also recommend you use Capstar tablets in combination with other longer-term flea remedies such as the Sentry Oatmeal Flea Shampoo.
