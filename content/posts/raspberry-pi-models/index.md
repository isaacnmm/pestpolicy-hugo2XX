[Raspberry](https://pestpolicy.com/best-raspberry-pi-3-starter-kits/)Pi Models are popular among single-board super-computing enthusiasts and is described as a small Linux-based computer on a single small board. - Raspberry Pi 1, released in 2012, may be used with the PC monitor or Television and with your standard mouse or keyboard.

The credit-card-sized board (computer) allows you to undertake essential computer functions such as playing games and videos, processing word and excel documents using Python programs, and a fantastic [micro-SD card](https://pestpolicy.com/[best](https://pestpolicy.com/best-pcie-wireless-card-for-gaming/)-sd-card-for-raspberry-pi-3/).

##  Reviews: Top 7 Best Raspberry Pi Models for 2025

###  **1. Raspberry Pi 2 Model B Desktop - #1 Pick**

Raspberry Pi 2 Model B came to replace the Pi Model B+. Notably, Pi 2 Model B is about 6 times faster than Pi Model B+. It has 40 pins extended GPIO and is total HAT compatible and has a 3. 5mm audio jack, HDMI port, and 4 x USB ports.

It requires about 30 percent of the power needed by Model A+ & Model B+.

It runs at 900MHz power consumption and has better RAM (1GB RAM). It comes with a superior power management system that allows you to offer 1. 2 Amp to your USB ports. - This is possible because it comes with a quad-core processor, 1GB RAM, and an updated chipset. - Note that Pi 2 Model BV1. 2 utilizes BCM2837 SoC, whose processor is ARM Cortex-A53.

- Raspberry Pi 2 Model B will comfortably run Windows IoT and thus will attain top performance in your projects.

Equally, Pi 2 Model B has back-compatibility and therefore, will work with the Model B+ components and cases since it has a similar layout and footprint.

###  [2. Raspberry Pi Model A+ - #2 Raspberry Pi Pick](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PEX05TO/?tag=p-policy-20)

Raspberry Pi Model A+ was an upgrade from the very first 2012 model Raspberry Pi Model A: which was released in 2013. However, Pi Model A+ is an inferior form of Raspberry Pi Model B+ but it comes with a RAM of 512MB, a single USB port, is full-size but lacks Ethernet just like Pi Zero. - Notably, it is a very cheap Linux computer. The Pi Model A+ enhanced school programming learning and science project completion.

- The significant enhancements over the Model A (that consumed 750mA) include efficient power consumption, a micro SD card socket to guard your SD card, and is compatible with an expanded GPIO header with forty pins. It has a 3. 5mm jack, which offers an additional audio port or video out for analog gadgets. Further, if you love utilizing soldering iron, its GPIO (40pin extended) has a header.

Further, it runs with just a third of the powerrequired, with its switching regulators, to run Raspberry Pi Model B+ and thus will be useful (consumes the only 600mA) for projects using solar and battery, which includes WiFi repeaters and robots. - It comes with full-size HDMI, its power source is Micro USB and has a DSI display. With just 700MHz of processor and 256MB of RAM, I would consider the Raspberry Pi Model A+ as wanting in power.

###  **3. Raspberry Pi Model B+ (B PLUS) _#3 Pick**

Compared to Raspberry Pi A+, and B, the Model B+ is cheap and more adaptable, has 4 x USB Ports, reduced power consumption (600mA), 40 Pin GPIO, and has a Micro SD Port. The board comes with a 40 Pin GPIO, enhanced connectivity (4 USB-ports allowed), and better power consumption. - Since it has switching regulators, the Pi Model B+ will consume much less power. - Also, its power supply produces reduce noise, and it has superior audio.

Great for general applications that require good connectivity. - With the 40 Pin GPIO, Raspberry Pi Model B+ has backward compatibility with other boards that used the 26 pins. Compared to the Model B, the Model B+ (has 2 USB 2. 0 ports) comes with 4 USB 2. 0 ports. Also, it is compatible with OS like OpenELEC and has a small form factor.

However, be cautious because the cases for Model B are not compatible with the Raspberry Pi Model B+.
