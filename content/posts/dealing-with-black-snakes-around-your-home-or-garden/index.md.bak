Encountering a [snake](https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-snakes/),especially a long, dark one, can be an unnerving experience for many homeowners. While the immediate reaction might be fear, it's important to remember that many "[black](https://pestpolicy.com/black-gutters-on-brick-house-ideas/)snakes" commonly found in gardens are non-venomous and actually beneficial to the ecosystem.

These reptiles play a crucial role in controlling populations of rodents and other pests, making them valuable allies rather than threats. However, knowing how to identify them, understanding their behavior, and taking appropriate safety measures are key to ensuring a peaceful coexistence.

In regions like Kenya, where a diverse array of snake species exists, identifying a "black snake" can be more complex, as several species might fit this description, some of which could be venomous. This guide will focus on general principles for dealing with black snakes, emphasizing identification, safety, and humane deterrence, providing a framework for managing encounters around your home and garden responsibly.

##  Identifying "Black Snakes" - A Local Context

When someone refers to a "black snake, " they often have a specific non-venomous species in mind, such as the Eastern Ratsnake (*Pantherophis obsoletus*) or Black Racer (*Coluber constrictor*) in North America. These are common and harmless. However, in Kenya, "black snake" can refer to a wider range of species, and accurate identification is paramount.

Here are general characteristics to observe, but always consult local wildlife experts for definitive identification:

* **Size and Build: ** Black snakes can range from slender to robust. Note the length and thickness. * **Scales: ** Are they glossy or dull? Smooth or keeled (ridged)? * **Head Shape: ** Triangular or oval? Is the head distinct from the neck? (Note: While often cited, head shape alone is not a definitive indicator of venomousness, as many non-venomous snakes can flatten their heads when threatened). * **Pupils: ** Round or slit?

(Round pupils are generally, but not exclusively, associated with non-venomous snakes). * **Behavior: ** How does it move? Is it aggressive, or does it try to escape? Does it rattle its tail (even if it doesn't have a rattle)? Does it coil in a striking posture? * **Markings: ** Even if predominantly black, look for subtle patterns, bands, or specks of other colors, especially on the underside or when scales separate.

**Important Note for Kenya: ** Several common "black" or very dark snakes in Kenya include:

* **Black Mamba (*Dendroaspis polylepis*): ** Highly venomous. Long, slender, active, often arboreal. Mouth lining is dark. * **Cobra species (e. g. , Black-necked Spitting Cobra, Forest Cobra): ** Can be very dark or black. Venomous. May rear up and spread a hood when threatened. * **House Snakes (*Boaedon fuliginosus* or *lineatus*): ** Common, non-venomous, nocturnal. Often dark brown to black, can have iridescent sheen. Slender. Beneficial.

* **Mole Snakes (*Pseudaspis cana*): ** Can be uniform black, non-venomous but will hiss and strike defensively. Robust body. Excellent rodent control.

**Always assume a dark-colored snake in Kenya could be venomous unless you are 100% certain of its identification as a harmless species. Err on the side of caution. **

##  Why Snakes Are In Your Garden

Snakes are attracted to areas that provide:

1. **Food Sources: ** Rodents (mice, rats), frogs, lizards, insects, and sometimes bird eggs. If you have a rodent problem, you're likely to attract snakes. 2. **Shelter: ** Tall grass, dense shrubs, rock piles, woodpiles, compost heaps, leaf litter, debris, foundations, and cracks in structures offer hiding spots from predators and extreme weather. 3. **Water: ** Bird baths, leaky faucets, ponds, or even consistently damp areas. 4.

**Warmth/Coolth: ** Paved areas and rocks can provide warmth for basking, while shady spots or burrows offer refuge from heat.

##  Safety Precautions When Encountering a Snake

Your safety and the snake's well-being are paramount.

1. **Do Not Approach or Provoke: ** Give the snake plenty of space. Do not attempt to touch, pick up, or harass it. Most bites occur when people try to handle or kill snakes. 2. **Remain Calm: ** Sudden movements can startle a snake. If you discover a snake nearby, freeze, then slowly back away. 3. **Identify if Possible (from a safe distance): ** Use binoculars if necessary. Note its size, color, patterns, and behavior.

**Do not get close for identification. ** 4.

**Assume Venomous (especially in Kenya): ** If you are unsure of the species, treat it as potentially venomous. 5. **Keep Pets and Children Away: ** Ensure curious pets and children do not approach the snake. 6.

**Call for Professional Help: ** If the snake is in a dangerous location (e. g. , inside your house, in a high-traffic area, or you suspect it's venomous) and you are uncomfortable dealing with it, contact: * Local wildlife removal services. * Snake rescue organizations.

* Your local KWS (Kenya Wildlife Service) office or a registered snake handler if in Kenya. 7. **Do Not Attempt to Kill: ** Killing snakes is often illegal, dangerous, and unnecessary. Many species are protected, and you risk a bite.

##  Dealing with Non-Venomous Black Snakes

If you're certain the snake is non-venomous and it's in an undesirable location:

1. **Leave It Alone: ** Often, if left undisturbed, the snake will move on its own within a few hours. 2. **Gentle Encouragement: ** For snakes on a patio or walkway, you can gently spray it with a garden hose from a distance to encourage it to move away. Alternatively, use a long broom or rake to gently nudge it towards a safe exit point. 3. **Provide an Escape Route: ** Ensure it has a clear path to nearby cover (e. g. , a bush, tall grass). 4.

**Capture and Relocate (with extreme caution, only if knowledgeable): ** If you are experienced and comfortable, you can use a long stick and a bucket or a specialized snake hook to gently scoop the snake into a container and release it in a suitable, remote location away from homes. This is generally best left to professionals.

##  Preventing Snakes in Your Yard and Garden

The best way to deal with snakes is to make your property less inviting to them.

1. **Eliminate Food Sources: ** * **Rodent Control: ** Implement effective rodent control strategies. Seal entry points into your home, keep pet food secure, clear fallen fruit, and manage garbage. This is the single most effective deterrent. * **Insect Control: ** Manage insect populations, especially grubs and slugs, if they are abundant and attracting snakes. 2.

**Remove Shelter and Hiding Spots: ** * **Mow Lawns Regularly: ** Keep grass short, especially near foundations and outbuildings.

* **Clear Debris: ** Remove piles of rocks, logs, firewood, leaf litter, and construction debris. Store firewood on racks elevated off the ground. * **Trim Landscaping: ** Keep shrubs and bushes trimmed, especially those close to the ground or house. * **Seal Entry Points: ** Seal cracks and crevices in your home's foundation, around pipes, and under doors. Use snake-proof mesh over vents. 3.

**Manage Water Sources: ** Fix leaky faucets, remove standing water, and consider modifying bird baths to be less appealing to snakes (e. g. , raised, with steep sides). 4. **Physical Barriers (for specific areas): ** * For highly sensitive areas (e. g. , children's play areas, chicken coops), consider installing snake fencing.

This is typically a fine-mesh hardware cloth or similar material, buried at least 15-30 cm (6-12 inches) deep and extending 60-90 cm (2-3 feet) high, with the top few inches angled outwards to prevent climbing. 5. **Predator Awareness: ** Encourage natural predators of snakes, such as birds of prey, if appropriate for your area.

##  Final Thoughts

Encountering a black snake in your home or garden can be startling, but it's crucial to react calmly and responsibly. While some black snakes, particularly in regions like Kenya, can be venomous, many are harmless and even beneficial pest controllers. Prioritize safety by never approaching or provoking a snake you cannot definitively identify as non-venomous.

Focus on making your yard less appealing to snakes by eliminating their food sources and hiding spots.

By understanding snake behavior and implementing preventative measures, you can create a safer environment for both your family and these fascinating, often misunderstood, creatures. If ever in doubt, or if a snake is in a dangerous location, always contact a local wildlife professional for safe and humane removal.
