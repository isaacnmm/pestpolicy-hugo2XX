## Reviews: 7Top 7 Best Joystick for Elite Dangerous 2025
### [1. Thrustmaster Hotas Warthog Stick and Throttle - #1 Pick](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CBVHJ00/?tag=p-policy-20)
We found that the Warthog joystick lacks the toy-like feeling in other joysticks. Thrustmaster Hotas Warthog FlightStick has a dual throttle control panel and system and a USB connection that allows upgradeable firmware.
The A-10C name indicates that the United States Air Force has authorized the H.O. test like a replica of the real a-10 Warthog in military applications.
For example, other joystick setups feel too light and flop around, and you can feel the cheap plastic construction features that are not in Thrustmaster Hotas!
As a high-end joystick, the designers of Warthog aimed to give you value for money by making the device remarkable at 3 kilograms. The device has a weighted and stable base.
It has integrated metal enclosures at all the key areas such as the stick's housing and the base's body. Therefore, you are assured that the joystick will not be falling apart when you slam things while Elite Dangerous gaming.
You'll notice that Warthog is more fluid compared to other joysticks since its spring system has adequate tension to assist you in making accurate movements without no overshooting the target.
- Therefore, together with the four rubber pads at its bottom and even with no bolting on your desk through the provided screw holes, you'll not easily flop the setup around while using it typically.
Considering its button, Warthog has pinkie push buttons: 1 with a lever, one exposed, two standard push buttons, one dual metal trigger, one four-way hat with push functionality: 8-way point of view hat and 8 Way hats.
The 16-bit resolution joysticks, with a five coil spring system, will offer you a firm linear and fluid tension, which has no dead zones.
With HallEffect AccuRate (H.E.A.R.T.) with 3D magnetic sensors technology, the joystick has surgical precision and will maintain the quality over a long time. Read Also:

Also, the spring systems will help you remain steady. However, if you need to play arcade shooters through fast activating twitch triggers and buttons, then the Warthog metal trigger could feel heavy and will have a long travel distance and thus can be too slow in comparison to others like the aviator.

- To increase stability, the joystick has a broad base build and will come with rubber pads to prevent slipping while you are gaming.
- However, we won't label this as an ambidextrous joystick since it will not be appropriate for left-handed gamers.

Therefore, you'll not necessitate installing any special software or drivers. You can thus purchase theImperial Eagleship, which won't need a navy rank, and use theLogitech Extreme 3D Pro to start combat.
Further, the joystick will be automatically formatted for most flight-sim gaming. However, in this case, you'll require programming the stick switches on the stand and the top.

### [4. Saitek X52 Pro Flight](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000LQ4HTS/?tag=p-policy-20)
The X52 Pro joystick is created by Saitek that comes in the form of throttle and joystick. Saitek X52 Pro Flight's trigger has dual actuation points and permanent blue L.E.D. lights.
Has enabled tension adjustment progressive throttle and two fire buttons, which will enable you to operate the spaceship as you move to the open galaxy.
Has precision-centering mechanism and Advanced Multi-Function Display (MFD) for near-realistic Elite Dangerous flying experience.
However, you can use the X 52 and X 52 Pro without sticks. There is a cable a serial cable that links the stick to the throttle and the throttle plugs to the P.C. through a USB. X52 Pro is considered a lower-end joystick.
Despite that the device is made from plastic, it feels solid for the plastic stick it is. Also, the throttle feels very textured and smooth.
The stick has buttons that are appropriately placed at its base and has three switches (t1 to t6) that you can set up to turn on the shaft or shield cell bank.
The buttons are appropriately placed for the fingers and thumb to reach. Further, the throttle has two wheels that you can use for a head look or navigate between panels.
- The stick also has a pinky switch that you can use as a secondary combination button to allow you to double the configuration.
- The two rotary dials and two dedicated MFD buttons have inbuilt buttons that will enable better control of the game's functionality.
X52 pro allows a detailed flight simulator using multifunction LCD and a fantastic 105 programmable commands. Therefore, you'll easily control your Elite Dangerous flight plan using a stopwatch and clock function.
The stick's lighted buttons will enable you to know the point to press quickly. Also, the fantastic display will offer information on the button configuration.
Further, the device will allow increased X-Y control through the use of non-contact technology. Compatible with: War Thunder, Star Citizen, Rise of Flight, and Elite: Dangerous.
One challenge I identified with the Saitek X52 Pro is that the sticky is adequately grippy, and it has a twist functionality to actuate the rudder  a 3D Twist Rudder Control.
Therefore, when you are twisting the stick, you'll need to clamp down using a lot of strength. However, you can use grip tape to solve this problem permanently.

### [5. Thrustmaster T.16000M FCS HOTAS](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KCHPRXA/?tag=p-policy-20)
Thrustmaster T.16000M FCS HOTAS is my top elite dangerous joystick.
It features T.W.C.S. and the H.E.A.R.T. magnetic precision technology with the characteristic ambidextrous use, which will make your gaming more realistic and have surgical precision.
- It will be great for both the right and left-handed elite dangerous gamers with minimal adjustments.

The stick's buttons have intentional and firm clicks, which will enable you to acknowledge the effect of each move you make in the Elite dangerous gaming.
The stick has a replacement rubber enabling a change to the right hand from the regular left-hand stick. Notably, Thrustmaster T.16000M FCS HOTAS is the only joystick that can change from left hand to right hand.
