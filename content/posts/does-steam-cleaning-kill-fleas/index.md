I recommend you use a combination of tools and other methods to try to get to control fleas - including preventing a re-infestation.

###  1. Flea-treat the Dog and Cat

As you try to control fleas, dealing with the bugs in your furry pets like cats or dogs is a challenging task. So, devise a comprehensive approach to control fleas in your living space and also on your pests.

But it won't help to treat the furry pets alone. This is because fleas are supper resilient and they hide inside crevices, upholstery, and carpet fibers. So, fleas treat cats, dogs, and other household animals. - Some of the treatments available for fluffy pets include flea sprays, flea combs, flea shampoos, oral medications, and topical treatments.

- For example, you can use aflea combto brush the pet and remove the bugs from the tail, belly, and neck.

Some precautions on this are to consult the veterinarian first before using these chemical solutions to flea treat and also you must not steam-clean the pets as it'll be fatal. - Besides, you must undertake regular post- or secondary treatment as this will help kill any eggs that may have escaped the primary steaming or treatment.

###  2. Wash Pet Bedding

Launder and dry the pet and other household bedding regularly using hot water and detergent as a post-treatment flea control method to help remove the bugs from those environments. - The high water temperature plus quality detergents will help kill flea eggs and adult fleas - but also dry the bedding well using the highest temperature setting.

However, if there is a severe flea infestation, you may consider taking the drastic step of discarding the bedding to help fully remove the flea eggs and larvae or adult fleas. - In addition, undertake regular washing of the bedding and the pets too as this will help keep the environment flea-free. Clean the pet's sleeping area and keep the spaces tidy by vacuuming the floors, sideboards, upholstery, and carpets.

###  3. Steam Cleaning Carpets and Furniture

Harness the power of steam cleaning on your furniture, surfaces, and carpets to remove fleas from your apartment or house. - The hot steam will get into the cracks and hidden spots to kill some of the flea eggs and also get deep into the fibers of upholstery and carpets. Steaming might not fully kill all fleas but it'll effectively reduce the number of bugs in your household or office.

- Check the steamer for manufacturer instructions and safety guidelines.

For example, you must not steam directly on your pets. Further, you should incorporate steam cleaning into your regular cleaning schedule. This will especially be important in areas such as carpets and pet bedding to help disrupt the reinfestation of the fleas.

##  Conclusion

Steam cleaning as a method to kill fleas should be combined with other methods such as vacuuming, [washing pet bedding](https://pestpolicy.com/does-chlorine-safely-kill-fleas-on-cats/),or flea-treating the pets - this will help exterminate flea eggs and adult fleas.
