##  What Does Leopard Gecko Eat?

Leopard Gecko is an insectivorous animal (reptile) that mainly feeds on insects such as mealworms, crickets, cockroaches, super worms, or beetle. These insects provide strong nutrients that help the Leopard Gecko in bodybuilding and energy provision they are rich in proteins and carbohydrates.

Most of these insects are readily available in various climatic conditions (regions) and can be acquired commercially too. Normally, Leopard Gecko does not feed on vegetables or plant extracts. Below is detailed information on the best feed you can use for Leopard Gecko:

###  **1. Mealworms**

These are the primary source of food for Leopard Gecko that has a very high content of fat. They have a low or poor calcium-to-phosphorous ratio. Mealworms are easier to raise at home since they multiply rapidly. Never feed your Leopard Gecko with mealworm beetle. They have shells that cause impaction due to indigestion problems.

**Review of theZilla-Reptile Mealworm** - Nutritious food forLeopard Geckos, large Birds or Tropical Fish, hermit crabs, fence lizard, and Bearded Dragons - Doesn't requireRefrigeration - Resealable and Convenient Packaging - Has High Protein and Dehydrated Ingredient First, mealworms must be just a small portion of the Leopard Geckos' diet - most info sheets recommend that you feed the reptiles mainly with live food.

Give the leopard geckos, occasionally, just about a bowl of the mealworm food above. My red-slider turtle munched on the Zilla-Reptile Mealworm around its outdoor pond. For the leopard gecko, I made mustard greens salad and added the Mealworms for excellent nutrition. This has made the reptiles become muscular, healthy, and happy.

The Zilla-Reptile Mealworm has a great taste and smell - and offers its additional protein to the reptiles as well as being great for chickens and peafowl.

Also, it's suitable nutrition for sick geckos plus it won't spill since its plastic is strong enough allowing excellent sealing. The mealworms are dehydrated to offer the right nutrients and protein that'll help maintain the health of your leopard dragons. The 100-percent natural worms and thus your geckos will achieve the same nutrition like they're feeding on whole insects.

Pros - Nutritious food forLeopard Geckos just like whole mealworms - Doesn't requireRefrigeration - 100-percent natural - Resealable and Convenient Packaging - Has High Protein and Dehydrated Ingredients Cons - **It does not excite all dragons

###  2. Cockroaches - Do leopard geckos eat cockroaches?

Yes, Leopard geckos will many worms and bugs including Dubia Roaches (a great staple food), crickets, locusts, silkworms, hornworms, super-worms, and mealworms.

But are Dubia roaches too big for leopard geckos? Well, for leopard geckos that are in the juvenile stage, only feed them with 1/4-inch Dubia roaches. But for adult geckos, feed them with Dubai roaches that are medium-sized - this is a maximum of 1. 5 inches in length.

The cockroaches will offer great nutrition to your leopard gecko as they have high protein that'll keep your geckos healthy and active. Also, you should feed the gecko with whole-grain cereals, fruits, and fresh veggies too.

Tropical Cockroaches are the best tropical insects to use when feeding your Leopard Gecko within the tropics. The best cockroach species is Dubia roaches.

These are easier to raise they multiply very fast as long as proper hideouts and temperature are provided. Moreover, it has excellent nutrients necessary for your Leopard Gecko.

Dubai roaches and Turkestan cockroaches move slowly and are unable to climb walls this makes it easier to collect them as food when needed.

Do not feed your Leopard Gecko with cockroaches found in your shower/bathroom or damp areas these are usually non-nutritious and poisonous.

###  3. Crickets

Crickets are known to have a relatively good amount of proteins for your Leopard Geckos growth, unlike the mealworms and roaches.

They have low-fat content and can easily be dusted with other artificial food supplements when feeding your Leopard Gecko.

Crickets are popular since their movement, behavior, and biting give Leopard Gecko a chance to acquire hunting skills.

###  4. Waxworms

These worms are suitable for the sick Leopard Gecko and young ones since they contain a lot of proteins and fat.

They should be fed to adult Leopard Gecko once after every two or three weeks to prevent them from being obese. Waxworms can really be addictive to your Leopard Gecko. **5. Silk Worm** This is a very nutritious feed that will heal wounds and boost the immunity of your Leopard Gecko. They multiply very fast provided proper/optimum temperature is maintained. However, Silkworms only live a few weeks (you will need to order a few frequently).

Nevertheless, Crickets may be cumbersome to rare. They keep jumping out of the nest and often make a lot of noise. However, you can make a good breed if you instill proper care on crickets.

When collecting these insects from the fields, ensure that you do not pick them from places that are sprayed by any pesticide. It is also necessary that you may collect species that are recommended by the vet. **6. Alternatively**,

You can also feed your Leopard Gecko on artificially made food. This acts as a decoy to Leopard Gecko that has less appetite for live insects.
