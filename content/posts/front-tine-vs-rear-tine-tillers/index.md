##  Details: Front Tine vs. Rear Tine Tillers - Differences?

**- For new uncultivated Ground**: You might want to consider renting or buying a rear tine tiller. Its counter-rotating tines are just what you need to get started. - **For thoroughly worked soil**: A front tine tiller is more ideal for thoroughly worked soil and maintaining gardening soil on a regular basis. The user has to hold the equipment back to get a thoroughly tilled garden - more physical effort is needed for a hard ground surface.

##  Tilling depth

###  1. Front tined tiller

4-8 inches is considered the ideal tilling depth for front tined tillers. Its tilling width is adjustable, typically between 12 and 16 inches. - You will need muscle power to control the tilling depth of the tillage and in propelling the machine forward. - The design of the front line tiller renders it difficult to operate on hard and uneven ground surfaces.

As the tines pass over hard obstacles, they tend to jerk the tiller forward which renders it unsuitable for deep tillage.

###  2. Rear tine tiller

Rear tine tillers make it easy to till at relatively higher depths (8-10 inches) and width (20-30) inches on exceptionally hard ground. The wheels rotate at a set speed in forwarding or backward motion which allows the equipment to stay in place as the tines dig the ground to the preferred depth. - The tines of this equipment are designed to continue digging even after stopping the machine which allows it to dig deeper.

- Rear tine tillers are relatively larger, heavier, and pricier compared to front tined tillers of the same size. A rear tine tiller can be run single-handed as the user guides it along because the wheels are engine-powered. Related: How to Till a Garden without a Tiller

##  **Which Is Best? Front Tined or Rear Tined Tiller?**

Making the right choice when purchasing a tiller for your garden depends not only on the size of the tillage but also on the type of soil in question. - For compacted and rocky soil, a front tined tiller is more ideal. - As the rotating tines cut into the ground, the tiller is propelled forward, which in the process gets the garden ready.

The rear tine tiller is heavy-duty which is more ideal for landscapers and gardening enthusiasts. - They can take on larger tracts of land and prepare the soil to make it easier for cultivation. - Rear tine tillers are also easier to control which makes them for perfect gardening by making straight lines.
