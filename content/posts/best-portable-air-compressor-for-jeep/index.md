# # **How to Choose the Best Portable Air Compressor for Jeep**

Having a high performance air compressor on board your jeep can improve your overall confidence when you hit the road. However, finding an appropriate portable air compressor can be quite challenging because of the numerous offers in the market. Thus, there are some important considerations you should make before settling on a compressor for your jeep. These include:

## # **Size**

The size of your air compressor determines the ease with which you can move it around or load in your vehicle. A compact and lightweight equipment is preferred because it can be conveniently loaded in the car.

## # **Performance**

The performance of your air compressor depends on its rated maximum psi levels and flow rate. Higher psi levels allows you to inflate heavy duty tires. Flow rate refers to the amount of liters pumped into the tire per minute. The higher the flow rate, the lesser the time you take to inflate the tire. For your jeep, consider air compressors with a minimum of 80 psi.

## # **Accessories**

Consider an air compressor that comes with the necessary accessories to avoid incurring extra costs. The most important of these accessories include a hose, power cord and inflation valves/tips. The air hose and power cord should be of appropriate length to enable you attend to all the tires with convenience. In addition, they should be made from heavy duty materials so that they do not wear out after a while.

You might also opt for one that comes with a carry bag.

Carry bags are designed for storing the compressor and its accessories.

## # **Versatility**

Its a good idea to get an equipment that will enable you to inflate your jeep and also serve other purposes. You might need compressed air for inflating tires of other vehicles, bicycle, motorcycle, bed or soccer balls. Compressed air can also be used to clean equipment or gadgets such as electronics.

## # **Display**

Ensure your air compressor comes with an accurate display. This allows you to accurately monitor the tire pressure to avoid over inflation. If you prefer an analog display, make sure the gauge has small graduations to enable accurate pressure readings. Some air compressors come with both analog and digital displays. Thus, youre able to read the pressure accurately and easily.

## # **Safety**

The air compressor should have the necessary safety devices to protect the user and prevent equipment damage. For instance, some compressors allows you to set the required pressure for which pumping will stop automatically. Different brands of air compressors have different runtimes for which cooling is required. Some are equipped with thermal protectors which automatically stops the motor in case of undesirable heating.

The motor switches on automatically once the required working temperature is attained.

# # **Conclusion**

Power and speed are the most important things you need in a portable air compressor. This helps you keep your jeep tires always inflated no matter where youre. Also, durability of the equipment is of great importance. An equipment that is made with durable materials will go for many years without major break downs. So, depending on your budget and preferences, youll get a reliable product from the above list. **Sources: ** 1.
