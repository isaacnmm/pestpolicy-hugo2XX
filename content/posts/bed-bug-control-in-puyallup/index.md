These tiny pests are known for their ability to hide in small crevices and their resilience to many common pest control methods. - This guide provides practical tips and effective strategies tailored specifically for managing and preventing bed bug infestations in Puyallup.

##  Identifying Bed Bugs

Accurate identification is the first step in dealing with bed bugs. Here are some key characteristics: - **Appearance**: Bed bugs are small, oval, and brownish insects. Adult bed bugs are about the size of an apple seed, while nymphs are smaller and lighter in color. - **Bites**: Bed bug bites often appear in clusters or lines on exposed skin. They can cause redness, itching, and swelling.

- **Signs of Infestation**: Look for tiny reddish-brown fecal spots on bedding, mattress seams, and furniture. You might also find shed skins or live bugs in these areas.

##  Prevention Tips for Puyallup Homeowners

Preventing a bed bug infestation is much easier than eliminating one. Here are some tips to keep bed bugs at bay in Puyallup: 1. **Inspect Secondhand Items**: Puyallup residents often enjoy shopping at local thrift stores and garage sales. Carefully inspect used furniture, mattresses, and clothing before bringing them into your home. Bed bugs can easily hitch a ride on these items. 2.

**Be Cautious When Traveling**: When staying in hotels or other accommodations in Puyallup or beyond, check the bed and surrounding areas for signs of bed bugs. Keep your luggage off the floor and bed, and inspect it before returning home. 3. **Reduce Clutter**: Clutter provides hiding places for bed bugs. Keep your home tidy and reduce unnecessary items, especially in bedrooms.

Puyallup's mild climate can sometimes encourage indoor clutter as people store seasonal items. 4.
