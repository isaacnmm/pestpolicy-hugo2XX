## Our Top 5 Gutter Guards for 7
- Inch Gutters
For 7
- inch gutters, the market primarily consists of professional
- grade micro
- mesh systems and highly adaptable DIY solutions. The emphasis is on robust construction and superior filtration due to the critical nature of these large gutters.
1. **LeafFilter (Stainless Steel Micro
- Mesh with uPVC Frame
- Adaptable):** * **Expert Take:** LeafFilter, a leader in gutter protection, can often be adapted for wider gutter sizes, including 7
- inch. While their standard offering uses a uPVC frame, their core strength lies in their surgical
- grade **stainless steel micro
- mesh** (275 microns). This ultra
- fine mesh effectively blocks all debris, from large leaves to minute shingle grit, ensuring water flows freely.
Their professional installers are adept at custom fitting for non
- standard gutter sizes. * **
**Pros:**
- ** Exceptional debris filtration, handles extremely heavy rainfall, professional installation with a comprehensive **lifetime transferable warranty**, widely recognized brand. * **
**Cons:**
- ** Premium price point due to professional installation, uPVC frame might be a consideration for those prioritizing all
- metal construction, requires specific consultation for 7
- inch sizing.
2. **HomeCraft Gutter Protection (Aluminum Frame with Stainless Steel Micro
- Mesh
- Adaptable):** * **Expert Take:** HomeCraft's system features a heavy
- duty **aluminum frame** supporting marine
- grade **stainless steel micro
- mesh**. Their patented "raised diamond" design helps lift debris, promoting self
- shedding and preventing accumulation, which is critical for large, high
- flow gutters.
HomeCraft's professional installers can customize and adapt their system to fit 7
- inch gutters, ensuring robust protection. * **
**Pros:**
- ** Durable **all
- metal construction** (aluminum frame, stainless steel mesh), patented design for superior debris shedding and water flow, professional installation with a **lifetime transferable warranty**. * **
**Cons:**
- ** Premium cost, requires professional installation, specific adaptation needed for 7
- inch widths.
3. **All American Gutter Protection (Aluminum Frame with Stainless Steel Micro
- Mesh
- Customizable):** * **Expert Take:** All American Gutter Protection offers a very robust system with a sturdy **aluminum frame** and fine **stainless steel micro
- mesh**. They are known for their strong construction and willingness to customize solutions, often providing wider panels or specific configurations necessary for 7
- inch gutters.
This makes them a strong contender for non
- standard sizes where custom fabrication is key. * **
**Pros:**
- ** Heavy
- duty **metal construction**, highly effective debris blocking, offers customizable solutions for wider gutters, professional installation with a **lifetime performance guarantee**. * **
**Cons:**
- ** Professional installation required, can be a higher initial investment due to customization.
4. **MasterShield Gutter Guard (Aluminum Frame with Stainless Steel Micro
- Mesh
- Adaptable):** * **Expert Take:** MasterShield's innovative "split
- slope" design, combined with its robust **aluminum frame** and fine **stainless steel micro
- mesh** (sometimes with copper infusion), makes it a high
- performance choice.
While primarily designed for standard gutters, their system's flexibility and reliance on roof pitch for debris shedding can be advantageous when adapted by professional installers for wider 7
- inch applications. * **
**Pros:**
- ** Advanced micro
- mesh technology, exceptional self
- cleaning properties, durable **aluminum frame**, effective against very fine debris and organic growth, strong **lifetime transferable warranty**.
* **
**Cons:**
- ** Professional installation only, typically a higher price point, requires consultation for 7
- inch adaptation.
5. **Custom Fabricated Metal Micro
- Mesh or Perforated Guards (DIY/Specialty Fabrication):** * **Expert Take:** For a truly precise fit on 7
- inch gutters, especially if they have unique profiles, custom fabrication from specialized metal shops is often the most reliable solution. This involves creating guards from high
- gauge **aluminum** or **stainless steel** sheets, either micro
- meshed or perforated, to match the exact dimensions of your gutters.
This is typically a professional
- level DIY project or a service from specialty contractors. * **
**Pros:**
- ** Ultimate customization for any 7
- inch gutter size/shape, durable **all
- metal construction**, very effective filtration (if micro
- mesh is used). * **
**Cons:**
- ** Very high cost (if professionally fabricated), highly labor
- intensive DIY, requires specialized tools and expertise, no warranty on DIY performance, longer lead times for custom orders.

## Buying Guide for 7
- Inch Gutter Guards
Selecting the right gutter guard for specialized 7
- inch gutters demands an even higher level of scrutiny due to their critical function and potential for severe water damage if they fail.
### 1. Absolute Precision in Measurement
* **Critical Step:** Before anything else, **meticulously measure the exact inside width and profile of your 7
- inch gutters**. Variations, even slight ones, can compromise the effectiveness of the guard. 7
- inch gutters are often custom, so a "one
- size
- fits
- all" approach will not work.
### 2. Uncompromising Filtration Effectiveness
* **Micro
- Mesh is Paramount:** Given the large opening and high volume of debris 7
- inch gutters can collect, a **micro
- mesh design** is virtually non
- negotiable. This will effectively block all debris, including fine particles like pine needles, shingle grit, and seeds, which are highly problematic in any gutter, especially extra
- wide ones.
* **Avoid Coarser Screens:** Basic screens or perforated guards with larger holes will allow fine debris to pass through, leading to sediment buildup and clogs that defeat the purpose of installing guards.
### 3. Superior Material Durability and Strength
* **Heavy
- Duty Metal Construction:** Insist on guards made from robust metals like thick
- gauge **aluminum** (for the frame/body) and high
- grade **stainless steel** (for the mesh). These materials offer maximum resistance to rust, corrosion, extreme weather (heavy rain, snow, ice), and physical damage. * **Structural Integrity:** The guard must be able to withstand significant weight from accumulated debris or snow without sagging, warping, or detaching.
Look for systems that reinforce the gutter's structure.
### 4. Exceptional Water Handling Capacity
* **Designed for High Flow:** 7
- inch gutters are installed to manage massive water volumes. The gutter guard must not impede this flow, even during the most torrential downpours. The design should allow water to flow freely into the gutter while effectively shedding debris. * **Prevent Overshooting:** The guard must be engineered to prevent water from overshooting the gutter, a critical failure point that can lead to foundation damage.
### 5. Professional Installation is Highly Recommended
* **Expertise for Custom Fit:** For 7
- inch gutters, **professional installation is strongly advised**. These systems are complex, and getting a precise, secure fit is crucial. Professional installers have the experience, tools, and custom fabrication capabilities to ensure optimal performance and long
- term reliability.
* **Warranty Protection:** Professional installations typically come with comprehensive warranties that cover both the product and the labor, offering invaluable peace of mind for such a significant investment. * **Preserving Roof Warranty:** Professionals are trained to install guards without disturbing roof shingles, which could void your roof warranty.
### 6. Comprehensive Warranty and Guarantees
* A **robust warranty** is paramount for 7
- inch gutter guards. Look for: * **Lifetime Transferable Warranty:** A key indicator of quality and adds value to your property. * **"No
- Clog" Guarantee:** This is absolutely essential. It means the company guarantees your gutters will not clog, and they will remedy any blockages. * **Performance and Material Guarantees:** Covers the product's ability to perform and protects against material defects.
### 7. Aesthetic Integration
* While functionality is primary, consider how the guards will look on your large gutters. Most professional micro
- mesh systems are low
- profile and designed to blend in.
