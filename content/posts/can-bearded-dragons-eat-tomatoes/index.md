##  Why Bearded Dragons Must Not Eat Tomatoes Daily?

Tomatoes will provide nutritional benefits to your bearded dragons but let's first interrogate why you can use the fruit as your beardies staple or main diet as you care for the Bearded [Dragon](https://cvm.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Caring-for-your-Bearded-Dragon.pdf).**a.

High Acid content; ** Maybe your vet (like [Dr. Javier Nevarez does](http://facultypages.vetmed.lsu.edu/faculty/jnevare)) has mentioned that you limit citrus fruits (and related products) as food for your bearded dragons, but why? These fruits have considerable citric acid, which is harsh on the digestive system of your dragon.

Despite that tomatoes are not classified as citrus fruits (botanically), their citric acid content makes them unsafe to be fed to the dragons as they'll your dragon with severe dehydration and diarrhea. **b. High Phosphorus Levels; ** The high phosphorous in tomatoes when fed to dragons are comparable to kryptonite - they'll bind the calcium and thus reduces its chances of getting absorbed into the reptile's bloodstream.

Calcium is very critical to the health of the Bearded dragons and hence taking in tomatoes daily (which have high phosphorous) may cause [metabolic bone disease](https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/bearded-dragons-diseases)(MBD) - a hazardous disease that (if not treated) may kill or paralyze your dragons. Tomatoes have little calcium but the harmful phosphorus roughly six times that amount.

Quantitatively, safe foods for your bearded dragons must have a 1: 1 to 2: 1 range as the ratio of calcium to phosphorus - this ensures that calcium is more than the phosphorus. Considering the above phosphorous hazard to bearded dragons, tomatoes also have less levels of calcium and this will lead to poor nutrition when used as their main diet.

**c. Toxic Vitamin A; ** Tomatoes will hold high Vitamin A levels - and thus when the fruit-veggies are fed to the bearded dragons in large quantities, and maybe also using Vitamin A supplements, the reptile will show overdose symptoms resulting from excessive Vitamin A intake.
