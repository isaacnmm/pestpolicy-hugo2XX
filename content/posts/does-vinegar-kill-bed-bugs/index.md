Bed bugs prefer hiding in certain areas in your house. So, the first thing to do is to identify the infested areas. Use a flashlight to inspect along the baseboard, floorboard, and any crevices in the house. Check for bed bugs in the drawers and under your mattress.

## # **2. Vacuuming and Steaming**

A vacuum cleaner can help you pick bed bugs, nymphs, and eggs that are near the surface. Places to vacuum can include carpets, floor, sofa set, bed, curtains, among others.

Spray all your infested areas - with any of the suitable bed bug sprays. Start with your mattress and bed because these are the most affected places. Vinegar works best when saturated on a surface. So, you can drench your mattress, pillow, and cushions with vinegar and take them out for drying. Respray the house after a few days to kill bed bugs that might have survived.

# # **Limitations of Using Vinegar to Kill Bed Bugs**

Although vinegar can help you control a bed bug infestation, it has some limitations or downsides. Lets look at some of the restrictions.

## # **1. It Wont Kill Bed Bug Eggs**

It is easier to kill bed bugs with vinegar than it is to kill bed bug eggs. Bed bug eggs tend to be resilient to even the most effective insecticides. The outer shell shields and prevents vinegar from penetrating the egg. Thus, it cannot deter the eggs from hatching.

## # **2. It Has a Pungent Smell**

Vinegar is a strong acid with an offensive pungent smell. Of course, a few drops of vinegar cannot be very harsh. Since you will have to soak your room and other vinegar items, the smell can become quite unbearable. The smell is also persistent. Thus, it will take a long time before it can go out entirely.

## # **3. Vinegar Can Damage Furniture**

You will be using a highly concentrated vinegar to kill bed bugs. The acidic properties of vinegar can substantially damage your furniture, especially wood and surfaces, such as ceramics and granite. You are required to soak surfaces with vinegar. But these surfaces tend to be susceptible to the scouring effects of acetic acid. Undiluted vinegar can also damage your exposed skin. So, youll have to use gloves to prevent such injuries.

However, vinegar wont affect your couches, beds, and other fabrics.

## # **4. Won't clear Large Bed Bug Infestations**

Vinegar [kills bed bugs on contact](https: //pestpolicy. com/does-rubbing-alcohol-kill-bed-bugs/), leaving no residual activity. So, it wont have any effect on bed bugs once the surface has dried. If you dont manage to kill all bed bugs, they will emerge once more and continue breeding. For this reason, its advisable to spray vinegar frequently to kill bed bugs that escape previous treatments.

# # How to treat bed bug bites using apple seed vinegar:

When used properly, vinegar can provide a natural solution to bed bug infestation. However, like many other non-chemical bed bug treatments, it cannot provide a long term solution. Thus, it is necessary to combine it with other effective treatments such as chemical sprays and bed bug powders. If you have a persistent bed bug infestation, you need to seek help from a professional pest exterminator.
