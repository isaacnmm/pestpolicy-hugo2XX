When choosing the **best shower drain cleaner**, you can consider factors like effectiveness, safety, ease of use, and environmental impact. Selecting the right product will help prevent costly plumbing repairs and keep your [drains](https://pestpolicy.com/how-drain-cleaners-work/)flowing smoothly.

##  Key Factors to Consider

###  1.**Effectiveness**

Some products, like [**Green Gobbler**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0182VBOJE/?tag=p-policy-20),are known for their powerful formulas that quickly break down hair, soap scum, and grease. Effectiveness is key when choosing a cleaner, as it directly impacts how quickly and thoroughly the drain becomes unclogged. Look for products specifically designed to target your type of clog, whether its due to hair or grease build-up.

###  2.**Safety for Pipes and Septic Systems**

Some products, like [**Drano Max Gel Clog Remover**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003TS2R1A/?tag=p-policy-20),are formulated to be tough on clogs but gentle on pipes. Using harsh chemicals can damage your plumbing over time, so its important to choose a drain cleaner that is safe for all types of pipes, including PVC and metal.

For homes with septic systems, opt for septic-safe products to avoid disrupting the balance of bacteria essential for the systems function.

###  3.**Environmental Impact**

Environmentally friendly options, like **Biokleen Bac-Out Drain Care Gel**, offer effective cleaning power without harmful chemicals. These products use natural enzymes or bacteria to break down organic material in the drain, which is better for the environment and safer for your home. If reducing your ecological footprint is a priority, check for biodegradable and non-toxic labels.

###  4.**Ease of Use**

Some products, like **Liquid-Plumr Pro-Strength Full Clog Destroyer**, are designed to be user-friendly, requiring no special tools or complicated instructions. The ease of application can make a significant difference, especially if youre dealing with a [stubborn clog](https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner/)and need a quick fix. Most gel formulas are easy to pour directly into the drain without any mess.

###  5.**Speed of Action**

Some cleaners, such as **CLR Power Plumber**, work within minutes, while others might need to sit in the drain for a longer period to achieve full effectiveness. Fast-acting solutions are ideal for emergencies when you need to restore water flow quickly. However, slower-acting solutions can be more thorough and may prevent future clogs from building up again soon.
