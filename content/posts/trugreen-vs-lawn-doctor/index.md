When it comes to professional lawn care, [TruGreen](https://pestpolicy.com/trugreen-lawn-care-reviews/)and [Lawn](https://pestpolicy.com/10-essential-lawn-and-garden-tools-for-fall/)Doctor are two of the most recognized and widely available names in the industry. Both companies offer a comprehensive range of services designed to keep your lawn healthy, green, and free of pests and weeds.

However, they operate with slightly different models and have distinct reputations among homeowners.

Deciding between TruGreen and Lawn Doctor often comes down to specific needs, budget, and personal preferences regarding customer service and local vs. national operations. This guide provides a detailed comparison to help you make the best choice for your lawn.

##  My Take: TruGreen Vs. Lawn Doctor

In a nutshell, **TruGreen** often appeals to homeowners looking for a broad range of scientifically-backed services with extensive nationwide coverage and a more streamlined, centralized customer service approach. They are a powerhouse in the industry, offering a wide array of plans.

**Lawn Doctor**, on the other hand, tends to attract those who prefer a more personalized, local touch. Its franchise model means you're dealing with local business owners, which can lead to more tailored service and often better direct communication, backed by a strong satisfaction guarantee.

* **Choose TruGreen if: ** You prioritize comprehensive, science-backed plans, broad service availability, and don't mind a potentially less personalized customer service experience. * **Choose Lawn Doctor if: ** You value a more localized, hands-on approach, potentially better direct communication with technicians/owners, and a strong local satisfaction guarantee.

##  Cost: TruGreen Vs. Lawn Doctor

The cost for both TruGreen and Lawn Doctor varies significantly based on your lawn size, location, and the specific services or plans you choose. Both typically offer annual programs with multiple visits throughout the year.

**TruGreen Costs: ** * **Average Annual Cost: ** Roughly **$400 to $1, 500+ per year**. * **Per Application: ** Can range from **$50 to $225+** depending on the service and lawn size (e. g. , a basic plan for a 5, 000 sq ft lawn might be around $70-$80 per visit, while comprehensive plans or larger lawns are higher). * **Plans: ** TruGreen often has introductory offers, but prices can adjust in subsequent years.

They offer several tiered plans with different inclusions.

* **Specific Service Estimates: ** * Fertilization & Weed Control: $50 - $125 per application * Aeration & Overseeding: $200 - $300 per service * Mosquito Control: $75 - $200 per application

**Lawn Doctor Costs: ** * **Average Annual Cost: ** Generally ranges from **$300 to $900 per year**. * **Per Application: ** Typically **$50 to $100 per visit** for fertilization and weed control for an average-sized lawn. * **Plans: ** Being a franchise model, prices can vary more by individual location. They often offer more customized options.

* **Specific Service Estimates: ** * Fertilization & Weed Control: $50 - $100 per application * Aeration & Seeding: $350 - $900 per service * Mosquito & Tick Control: $65 - $85 per treatment

**Summary of Cost Differences: ** While initial quotes can vary, Lawn Doctor often has a slightly lower average annual cost, especially for basic fertilization and weed control plans. However, TruGreen's extensive plans might include more specialized treatments upfront, potentially making their comprehensive packages appear more expensive but also more inclusive.

It's crucial to get a personalized quote from both companies for your specific lawn to compare accurately.

##  TruGreen Vs. Lawn Doctor: Plans and Services

Both companies offer a core set of services focused on lawn health, but their plan structures and specialized offerings have some differences. Neither company typically offers regular lawn mowing services.

**TruGreen Plans and Services: ** TruGreen offers several annual plans, each building upon the last in terms of comprehensiveness:

* **TruMaintenance: ** Basic fertilization and weed control. * **TruHealth: ** Adds grub prevention and sometimes disease control to the TruMaintenance plan. * **TruComplete: ** Includes aeration and overseeding in addition to the TruHealth features. * **TruSignature: ** The most comprehensive plan, adding tree and shrub care to the TruComplete features.

* **TruNatural: ** Uses 100% natural, organic-based fertilizer and traditional weed control methods.

**Additional A La Carte Services: ** TruGreen also offers various stand-alone services that can be added to any plan or purchased separately: * Mosquito Control & Defense * Perimeter Pest Control * Flea & Tick Control * Soil Amendment & Analysis * Grub Prevention & Control * Disease Control

TruGreen emphasizes a "Healthy Lawn Analysis" by a PhD-certified specialist to tailor plans.

**Lawn Doctor Plans and Services: ** Lawn Doctor's offerings are typically built around core lawn care principles, but their franchise model allows for some local customization. Their main services include:

* **Core Lawn Care (Fertilization & Weed Control): ** This is their staple service, providing nutrient application and targeted weed elimination. * **Aeration & Power Seeding: ** Essential for relieving compaction and thickening turf. * **Tree & Shrub Care: ** Fertilization, disease, and insect control for ornamental plants.

* **Pest Control: ** * Mosquito & Tick Control (often branded as "Yard Armour") * Perimeter Pest Control (for the home's foundation) * Grub Control * Fire Ant Control (in relevant regions) * **pH Balancing/Soil Enrichment: ** Adjusting soil acidity for optimal growth. * **Natural & Organic Lawn Care: ** Options for environmentally conscious homeowners, varying by franchise.

Lawn Doctor often uses proprietary equipment like their "Turf Tamer" technology for precise application.

**Key Differences in Services: ** * TruGreen generally has more formalized, national plans with specific names. * Lawn Doctor offers more flexibility at the local franchise level for tailored solutions. * Both offer comprehensive pest control, but the specific names and bundling might differ. * Neither typically includes routine mowing.

##  Customer Reviews: TruGreen Vs. Lawn Doctor

Customer reviews for both large national lawn care providers tend to be mixed, reflecting the challenges of scaling personalized service across many markets. However, some trends emerge:

**TruGreen Customer Reviews: ** * **Praise: ** Customers often commend the effectiveness of treatments, visible improvements in lawn health (greener grass, fewer weeds), and the convenience of not having to DIY. The scientific backing and extensive training of their specialists are frequently highlighted.

* **Complaints: ** Common issues include communication problems (e. g. , missed service notifications, difficulty reaching customer service during peak times), perceived pushiness from sales representatives, and inconsistent service quality between different technicians or branches. Sometimes, customers report unexpected charges or difficulty canceling services.

**Lawn Doctor Customer Reviews: ** * **Praise: ** Many customers appreciate the personalized service from local franchisees and technicians. They often report good results with weed control and fertilization, and value the responsiveness of local offices when issues arise. The "Lawn Doctor Guarantee" is frequently cited positively.

* **Complaints: ** Similar to TruGreen, some customers experience inconsistent results or communication issues, though often less frequently attributed to a national call center. As a franchise model, service quality can be highly dependent on the individual local branch. Some customers mention higher pricing compared to local, non-franchise companies.

**Overall Customer Sentiment: ** Lawn Doctor generally has a slightly better reputation for customer satisfaction, particularly concerning communication and resolving issues at the local level. TruGreen, while effective, sometimes faces criticism related to its large corporate structure and call center interactions.

##  Availability: TruGreen Vs. Lawn Doctor

Both companies boast impressive nationwide footprints, making them accessible to a vast majority of homeowners in the United States.

* **TruGreen: ** Available in **48 states** across the continental U. S. This broad reach means they are likely to service your area regardless of where you live, with a high density of branches in populated regions. * **Lawn Doctor: ** Operates in approximately **40 states**.

While extensive, their presence is primarily through independently owned and operated franchises, meaning coverage can be more sporadic in less populated areas compared to TruGreen's more ubiquitous branches.

If you live in one of the few states not covered by Lawn Doctor, TruGreen might be your only major national option. Conversely, if you value supporting a local business model, Lawn Doctor's franchise structure offers that benefit where available.

##  Is TruGreen or Lawn Doctor the Best?

There's no single "best" choice, as the ideal lawn care provider depends on individual homeowner priorities:

* **For Comprehensive Programs & Broad Availability: ** **TruGreen** excels with its diverse, structured plans and virtually nationwide coverage. If you want a one-stop shop for almost any lawn issue and live in a less densely populated area, TruGreen might be the more accessible choice. * **For Personalized Service & Local Focus: ** **Lawn Doctor** often stands out due to its franchise model.

If you prefer building a relationship with a local team, appreciate direct communication, and value a strong local satisfaction guarantee, Lawn Doctor could be a better fit. * **For Cost-Conscious Homeowners: ** While both require custom quotes, **Lawn Doctor** sometimes offers slightly lower average annual costs for basic services. However, always get multiple quotes.

* **For Specific Needs (e. g. , Organic Options, Extensive Tree & Shrub Care): ** Both offer these, but the depth and availability might vary. TruGreen has a dedicated "TruNatural" plan, and both offer robust tree and shrub care, though TruGreen includes it in their highest-tier plan.

Ultimately, the "best" company is the one that provides the best results for *your* lawn, fits *your* budget, and offers the level of customer service *you* expect.
