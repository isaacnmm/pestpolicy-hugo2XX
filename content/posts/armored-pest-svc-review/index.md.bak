##  Details: Armored Pest SVC Review

Armored Pest Svc, however, provides their pest control to residential clients only. - You can book routine pest control or annual plans for the prevention of pests. The company claims that its pest control only utilizes non-toxic insecticides or pesticides. Also, they will use a suitable enclosure when handling household infestations. - For example, Armored Pest Svc uses BLUEguard in its pest prevention mission.

The company does not use traditional marketing but hires contract marketers who use a door-to-door sales strategy. I noticed that the company's contracts were highly advantageous to most homeowners as they comprehensively cover most common pests. For example, the technicians offered to remove spider webs and wasp nests that they found in the house during the preventative treatment.

- I can report that the preventative treatment (specifically the annual plan) is cheaper compared to using reactive pest treatment. Related: Orkin Pest Control Review

##  Negative vs Positive Reviews of Armored Pest SVC

I sought to examine if the claims by armor pest defense matched up to the reviews given by the customers. - My conclusion is that there was a negative correlation - where customers reported the Pest Control services as being of poor quality. However, the positive client reviews were notably many compared to the negative customer feedback. Celebrity client reviews reported harmful and concerning company operations and practices.

For example, some of the customers reported the other companies' door-to-door salespersons used overly aggressive strategies. - Some of the salespersons over-promised on the service quality, they underrepresented the contract's financial obligations, lied about the pest problems, and some even refused to leave customer premises.

Besides, other clients reported the company building services that one under-delivered or even where the [exterminators](https://pestpolicy.com/affordable-pest-llc-review/)never showed up. Further, other clients reported that the definitions exterminators sent to their premises were under-trained and thus showed ignorance and negligence leading to property damage.

So it is clear that the salesperson from the company tends to over-promise him by making the client sign the contract documents even when they can't deliver appropriately. Besides, even the clients that had positive reviews about a company noted that one has to be overly specific on the [pest](https://pestpolicy.com/american-pest-review/)control tasks to be accomplished under the procedure.

Unlike [other exterminators near you](https://pestpolicy.com/pest-control-near-me/),Armor Pest Defense shrinks the money-back guarantee with the annual plan in the fine print with exceptions and exclusions. - So overall my view is that Armor pest defense has very many negative reviews. However, the company's annual pest prevention contract may be suitable for households that have ongoing bugs problems including mice ants, and spiders.

- But as noted above you need to be overly specific with your requirements and direct exterminators on what must be done. - Also, be sure to carefully read the pest control contract prior to the official signing. Upsides - Includes reliable cleaning services - Offers a suitable annual contract - Uses pesticides and insecticides that are non-toxic Downsides - Many negative reviews - Performance and quality are unreliable - Overaggressive marketing
