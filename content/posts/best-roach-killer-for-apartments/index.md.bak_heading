Here's how to get rid of roaches in an apartment permanently
- you should choose the cockroach killer depending on where the roaches in your house are hiding. However, you might require more than just one kind of roach killer for a large apartment or a smaller house.
- While you might enjoy catching some roaches roaming around the house, it is no secret that there is a whole colony hiding at some location in your residence.
- However, spraying insecticides will kill the roaches only on contact.

Therefore, you should target the roaches in the areas they breed and live, making Bait Strips, Gels, and Combat baits highly effective in roach elimination. After creating a nest and accessing enough food and water, the roach population will increase rapidly.

Therefore, you will only see the roaches when they are looking for food, and water, when they are migrating to a new nest when their population has grown too large, or they are escaping from insecticides.
- Roaches taste the food and other substances using their feet. German roaches love light Karo Syrup, brown sugar, protein carbohydrates, and sucrose. However, when you mix sodium borate or boric acid, food
- grade Diatomaceous Earth baits; ensure to keep them out of reach of children and pets. Maybe you're wondering, should I use roach bombs, or maybe boric acid roach killer?

Well, in this article, I've reviewed some highly effective and [safe](http://npic.orst.edu/health/child.html)roach killers that'll help your kill those roaches in the house.
