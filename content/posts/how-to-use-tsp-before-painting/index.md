##  Details: How to Use TSP Before Painting

###  Step 1: TSP cleaner Prepping

You'll mix the TSP powder with some warm water (in a larger bucket) and use it to wipe down the surfaces - this enhances the paint's adhesiveness - which also TSP acts as a stain remover, removes mildew and molds. So, dilute your TSP using warm water in the ratio of 1/2 cup of the TSP with warm water (2 gallons). Once you get the cleaning mixture, take another container with some clean water. Ensure to stir with a paint stirrer to dissolve TSP.

For safety purposes, wear protective goggles and rubber gloves when working with the TSP cleaner. You'll require to dip some sponge into your TSP cleaner to wipe down your walls.

###  Step 2: Workstation or Area Prepping

It is time to prepare the workstation or work area that'll provide the location to wash the items to be cleaned (fast enough), such as the cabinet doors. The items will require some drying after cleaning, and thus, more things must be cleaned at once. So, gather all the cleaning materials before beginning the area preparation work. For example, recommend your cabinet doors from their boxes.

Place the doors on the surfaces that'll be safe to use with TSP.

With TSP, you can easily clean your furniture, such as cabinets and decks, in preparation for painting - considering the type of paint you're using. TSP (NA 3 PO 4 ) will also effectively remove soot build-upfrom walls.

###  Step 3: Cleaning with TSP

Remember to wear rubber gloves before you begin the cleaning task - this prevents skin irritation, particularly on any opening or small cuts on the hands. You may use a towel, rag, or even a sponge for cleaning. Remember to concentrate around the handles and corners and clean along the wood grain to remove dirt and grease that's build-up easily. Ensure the area is effectively ventilated before starting the cleaning - sander for wood trim.

Ensure to remove all or any grease that has built-up on the surfaces since residue may prevent effective paint adhering and thus reduce the quality of the final product.

###  Step 3: Rinse the Surfaces

Get some rag or cloth dipped in clean water and rinse the TSP cleaner and other residues from the clean surfaces such as cabinet doors. The clean water also rinses the excess grime or grease removed by TSP. Further, raise the cabinet doors as well as walls - before saving the surfaces and finally painting. You can also remove the tile backsplash for a better surface outlook, as seen in this guide.

Also, keenly rinse off the workspace and don't leave any TSP on the surfaces as it may harm other people. You may dump the excess TSP in the lawn, grass, or dirty - but ensure it won't drain into the streams, lakes, or sewer system. But for smaller quantities of the TSP solution that's left after the cleaning process, you may flash it down into the washtub drain, sink, or toilet. However, ensure to check the laws on disposal of hazardous waste.

###  Step 4: Surface Painting

Painting the item surfaces, including your cabinet doors, will take some time - but will equally freshen up the cabinet and door. Yet, you may avoid surface prepping if you're painting on a primed wall that's new. Remove the drapery hardware plus the draperies. Further, loosen your light fixtures and probably wrap them using plastic bags. For the switches and electrical outlets, get out their wall plates - use a good sprayer gun.

But for painting cleaning the surfaces, choose to work on chipped, peeling, and rough areas - you can remove the room furniture to see all the flaws - which you may cover using drop cloths. > See Also: > Paint for Concrete Walls in Basement

But TSP has both strong cleaning ability and abrasiveness, and hence it'll also remove the gloss from different surfaces, including decorative laminates and painted surfaces. Therefore, you can use TSP like a deglosser - this is when push ultimately comes to shove.

You can use borax to clean ( [just like with baking soda](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-remove-paint-from-metal-with-baking-soda/)) in addition to killing mildews and fungus on different surfaces. [Acetone](https://pestpolicy.com/does-acetone-remove-paint/)is also an excellent TSP substitu5re for cleaning - you can put the liquid in some spray bottle and get it to your surfaces, including the wooden doors or cabinets.

Another non-hazardous material to clean the surfaces is [vinegar for paint removal](https://pestpolicy.com/does-vinegar-remove-paint/)- it is a powerful and natural cleaner. It'll love not only just paint but also stick-on hooks, wallpaper paste, and decals from doors and cabinets.
