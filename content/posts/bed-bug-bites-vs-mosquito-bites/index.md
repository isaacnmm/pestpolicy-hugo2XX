##  **Bed Bug Bites Vs Mosquito Bites: Telling Them Apart**

###  **1. Appearance**

Both appear as red, raised lumps. Both can range in color from light pink to a brownish look. Both bites are also slightly raised from your skin. Besides, both are smooth when you touch them and appear swollen. When left untreated, the bitten area might attract germs and infections that can harm our health. Below is how you can treat them. There are certain things which you can do while a mosquito or a bed bug bites you.

They are not too dangerous but to avoid having severe symptoms, try to cure it before its out of hand. Related: steamers for bed bugs.

###  **2. Itchiness**

Both bites are itchy because their saliva contains chemicals. Your skin will itch upon a bite from either of them because they contain two different chemicals: Anticoagulant and Anesthetics. Anticoagulant stops blood from clotting. This allows them (bedbug and mosquitoes) to suck up blood for several minutes before the wound closes up. Anesthetic chemical leaves a numb feeling which prevents the bite from itching at.

First, this ensures you don't notice them feasting you, well, at least for seconds.

###  **3. Swelling**

Both bites will appear swollen, can't be squeezed and popped. The bitten area will swell as a response mechanism from your body to enable more blood to reach it. More blood ensures sufficient white blood cells that can help fight the threat of infections. More blood concentration in the bit area will see it swell, but it can't be squeezed nor popped.

###  **1. Size**

*Mosquito Bite: * Clears up faster, 3-4 days. *Bedbug Bite: * Takes longer to clear up, 1-3 weeks. Mosquito bites will disappear faster, usually after a maximum of 4 days, depending on how your body reacted. Over that length of time, the bite will gradually lose its swelling and smoother its normal color. For bedbug bites, however, it will take up to 3 weeks at most to clear up.

Those of us with a strong reaction to it will see the bite take a longer period to clear up.

###  **4. How they feast**

*Bedbug Bite: * appears on parts of the body close to the mattress. *Mosquito Bite: * appears anywhere that was exposed.

*Mosquito bites: * transmits Malaria. *Bedbug bite: * don't transmit diseases; they, however, contain pathogens that can be harmful.

For bedbugs, they don't carry any disease; however, the wound can lead to the entry of germs in our bodies when left untreated.

###  **6. Who They Bite.**

Mosquitoes bite not only humans but also many other animals like birds. Mosquitoes are categorized into different species, and each has their preferences on what to feast on. Some prefer humans over other animals. Contrary to that, bedbugs have a specific diet: human blood. Although bedbugs do feed from other animals in some cases, they stick to humans for most of their lives.

Their preference for human blood has been attributed to the host's convenience, given they cannot [fly nor jump](https: //pestpolicy. com/do-bed-bugs-fly/). Also, the human [skin has an easier surface to bite](https: //pestpolicy. com/can-bed-bugs-live-in-your-skin/) through compared to that of furrier animals.

##  **Where are you likely to get Mosquitoes and Bedbugs?**

Both bedbugs and mosquitoes are scattered across the country, depending on the nature of the location. Bedbugs are most common in populated settlements like cities and suburbs. The higher the population, the more the bedbugs. The proximity of households enables the easier [movement of bedbugs](https: //pestpolicy. com/do-bed-bugs-jump/) from one house to another.
