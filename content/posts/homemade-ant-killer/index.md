## Top 15 Homemade Ant Killer Recipes
### 1. Boric Acid and Peanut Butter Straws
These are excellent homemade ant killers to eradicate ants without exposing your kids and pets to toxic substances.
Since the peanut butter and the moderately toxic
boric acid
are contained in the plastic straws, there are fewer chances of being ingested by kids and pets.
The bait does not leave a sticky mess on your floor or any surface it is left.
*Requirements*
:
Boric acid
and Peanut butter
*Equipment*
: Plastic straws, Mixing bowl, Spoon or whisk, and a knife
**Directions**
1. Mix 1 teaspoon of boric acid with one teaspoon of peanut butter in a mixing bowl.
2. Fill plastic straws with the paste.
3. Cut the straws into 2-inch pieces and place them in places most frequented by ants.
4. Ants will be attracted by the peanut butter and get killed by the boric acid. Ants are social creatures that love doing everything together.
5. So, they will take the pieces back to the colony, hence distributing the poison to more ants.

### **2. Food-Grade Diatomaceous Earth Ant killer**
Diatomaceous earth powder provides a non-toxic and inexpensive way to kill ants at home. DE powder is available from a local shop or online.
It contains sharp microscopic pieces that pierce into the insects exoskeleton.
Once inside the body, the pieces will dehydrate the insect to death. The powder is, however, not dangerous to humans and other animals.
*Requirements*
:
Diatomaceous earth
powder.
**Directions**
1. Begin by accessing your house to locate the infested places, trails, and common entry points.
2. To use DE powder, spread a generous amount on groups of ants and create a barrier around them. Also, apply a thin layer along the trails.
3. Apply the powder on the floor, baseboards, windows, and any crack that you usually see ants coming out from. In very narrow spaces, you can dust the powder using a soft cloth or duster. Just dip the cloth in the powder and flick it over the cracks.
4. Check the area after one or two days for dead ants. If theres no more ant activity, you can clean the area andwash it with soap. This will clear the pheromones to prevent more ants from coming in.
5. If the ants migrate to other locations or create alternative tracks, reapply the DE powder on these surfaces.
6. For outdoor use, apply the DEpowder along the building'sfoundation to kill ants at their entry points. Apply a generous amount at the most notorious entry points to kill as many ants as possible.
### **3. Sugary Baking Soda Ant Killer**
If youre looking for a natural and non-toxic ant killer, then you can prepare one at home using baking soda.
Its a safe recipe to use inside the house. However, it can harm your pets if consumed in large amounts.
Ants may shy away from the baking soda. But the sugar in this recipe will attract them to the bait.
*Requirements*
: Baking soda and Confectioners Sugar
*Equipment*
: Measuring spoon, Jar lids, and Mixing bowl
**Directions**
1. Mix equal portions of baking soda and confectioners sugar in a mixing bowl. Confectioners' sugar is used because ants cannot differentiate it from baking soda. If you use regular sugar, ants will eat sugar and leavebaking soda.
2. Put the mixture in several jar lids and place them in strategic places in the house. Place the bait at the cracks they use to access your house and common meeting points.
3. Sprinkle the bait in narrow cracks such as along the baseboard.
4. Wipe out the mess in your house after the ants have died.
5. For outdoor use, sprinkle the bait along the foundation of the house and entry points.
6. Also, treat the ant mounds and common nesting locations such as trees, woodpiles, and stone piles.

### 4. Boric Acid and Sugar Liquid Ant Trap

Borax is a very effective insect killer
.

*Requirements*
: Boric acid, Sugar, and Warm water
*Equipment*
: Mixing bowl
**Directions**
1. Mix 30g of boric acid with about 250g of sugar in a mixing bowl. Your bowl should be large enough to hold water.
2. Add water while stirring to prevent the formation of lumps.
3. Stir until all the boric acid and sugar is dissolved into a thin paste
4. To lay your bait, find a suitable location, preferably an area where ants love to congregate.
5. Pour the paste into jar lids and distribute them around the area. Pour some baits on the surface near the jar lids to lure the ants into the bait stations.
6. Leave the bait undisturbed for a couple of days. Ants will eat the bait and take more to their nest. Keep on refilling the jar lids with the bait until you get satisfactory results.
7. Store the remaining bait in a labeled, airtight container away from the reach of kids and pets. Keep it in a cool dark place.
### **5. Vinegar and Water Ant Spray**
Vinegar works in two ways against ants - a great homemade ant killer. When sprayed directly on the ants, it can kill them instantly.
You can also
spray on the bed bug trails
, entry points, and emerging points to deter them. Ants hate vinegar because it blocks their communication aids (pheromones).
This prevents ants inside the house from following the trail of others and deters new entries. Vinegar also discourages ants from your house by interfering with their ability to smell food.
*Requirements*
:
Apple vinegar
and Water
*Equipment*
: Spray bottle
**Directions**
1. Mix equal portions of cider vinegar and water in a spray bottle.
2. Shake the contents thoroughly until they mix properly
3. To use the solution, spray on ant trails. Usually, ants will follow the scents of others in the trail. Spraying along the trail will deter ants from following the path they have been using.
4. Spray the solution in areas where ants usually emerge out in large numbers, such as baseboards, cabinets, and windows. This will prevent the ants outside the house from picking up the scent.
5. For a large number of ants, you can saturate them withvinegar to killthem. Allow some time and come back to wipe the carcasses.
6. Apply the vinegar solution at least two times a week. For more effectiveness, you can increase the vinegar concentration.
