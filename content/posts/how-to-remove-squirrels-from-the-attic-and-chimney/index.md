Hearing the distinct sound of scratching, scurrying, or rolling nuts in your attic or chimney is a sure sign that a squirrel has moved in. This is a common problem for homeowners, but one that requires an immediate and strategic response to prevent significant damage.

The only safe and permanently effective way to remove squirrels is a two-step process: **first, you must allow the animals to leave on their own using a one-way exclusion door, and second, you must immediately seal all potential entry points to prevent their return.** Trapping and relocating squirrels is often illegal and ineffective, and using poisons creates a bigger problem when the animal dies in an inaccessible wall void.

### The "Why": Why Your Attic is a Perfect Home

A squirrel's primary motivation for entering your home is to find a safe, dry, and predator-free location to build a nest and raise its young. Your attic and chimney provide the perfect five-star accommodations. They will chew through siding, tear apart fascia boards, and exploit any existing gaps to gain entry. Once inside, they can chew on electrical wiring (creating a serious fire hazard), tear up insulation, and saturate areas with droppings and urine.

### The Field-Tested Removal & Exclusion Plan

This is the humane and effective method used by wildlife control professionals.

#### Phase 1: Inspection and Identification of the Primary Entry Point

You must find out how they are getting in and out.

1.  **Listen and Watch:** During the early morning and late afternoon, squirrels are most active. Listen from inside to pinpoint the area with the most noise. Then, go outside and watch your roofline from a safe distance. You will eventually see the squirrel leaving or entering.
2.  **Look for the Hole:** The entry point will typically be a hole about the size of a baseball. Common locations include:
    *   Where the soffit meets the roofline (a common spot for them to chew).
    *   Damaged or missing roof vents.
    *   Holes in the fascia board behind the gutters.
    *   An uncapped chimney flue.

#### Phase 2: Install a One-Way Exclusion Door

This is the most critical piece of equipment. A one-way door is a device that allows the squirrel to push its way out of the hole but prevents it from getting back in.

1.  **Secure the Area:** Before installing the door, use 1/4-inch hardware cloth (a heavy-duty wire mesh) to temporarily seal off **all other potential entry points** you may have found. This forces the squirrel to use the primary exit where you will place the one-way door.
2.  **Install the Door:** Securely mount the one-way door directly over the primary entry/exit hole according to the manufacturer's instructions.

#### Phase 3: Wait and Confirm

*   **Be Patient:** It may take a day or two, but the squirrel will eventually leave to forage for food and will be unable to re-enter.
*   **A Critical Warning about Babies:** The most common time for squirrels to enter attics is during the spring nesting season (March-May). If you suspect a mother has babies inside, **DO NOT install the one-way door.** She will cause immense damage trying to get back to them, and the babies will die in your attic. In this situation, you must either wait a few weeks for the young to be old enough to leave with the mother, or call a professional wildlife removal service.

#### Phase 4: The Permanent Repair

Once you are certain the attic is empty (you haven't heard any noise for several days), remove the one-way door and perform a permanent, professional-quality repair on the hole. Use metal flashing, wood, and new hardware cloth to ensure it is stronger than it was before. This is the only way to guarantee they won't chew their way back in next season.

### FAQ

**Q: Can I just trap the squirrel in a cage and relocate it?**
A: This is generally a bad idea and is illegal in many states. Relocated squirrels have a very low survival rate in a new, unfamiliar territory. Furthermore, if you haven't sealed the entry point, a new squirrel will simply move into the now-vacant prime real estate within a few days. The problem is the hole, not the squirrel.

**Q: What do I do if the squirrel is in my chimney?**
A: First, ensure the fireplace damper is closed and secure. Often, a squirrel has simply fallen in and can't get out. A simple solution is to lower a thick rope (at least 3/4-inch) down the flue from the roof. The squirrel can climb the rope and escape on its own. Once it is out, you must install a professional chimney cap to prevent it from happening again. Never start a fire to "smoke them out"â€”this will lead to a panicked, and likely injured or dead, animal inside your home.

**Q: Will mothballs or strobe lights make them leave?**
A: No. These popular DIY repellents are completely ineffective. A squirrel that has found a safe place to nest will not be deterred by a bad smell or a flashing light. The only permanent solution is physical exclusion.
