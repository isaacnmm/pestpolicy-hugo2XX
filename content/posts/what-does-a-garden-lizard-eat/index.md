What Does a Garden [Lizard](https: //pestpolicy. com/are-lizards-poisonous/) Eat? A [garden](https: //pestpolicy. com/10-essential-lawn-and-garden-tools-for-fall/) lizard is a great reptile pet for homeowners. These reptiles (Calotes Veriscolor ) also known as oriental garden lizards reside in warm areas like Asia.

You'll find these lizards in grass, trees, and bushes. They are always behind the scenes observing their environment quietly. *But the question is, what does a garden lizard feast on? * - **In summary, garden lizards eat snails, caterpillars, insects, small crickets, and some greens and fruits. They also dont consume much. ****Garden lizards work with small portions at a time**.

- **The oriental garden lizard feeds on insects such as ants, cockroaches, ants, and grasshoppers.

They also eat small vertebrates such as rats and also eat other lizards. **

# # What Does a Garden Lizard Eat?

The garden lizard has teeth and they are used for gripping the prey. They do not tear the prey when eating, they swallow it whole. The young and inexperienced garden lizards normally choke if the prey is too large for them.

1. Baby Snakes- Surprising but true. The garden lizard can eat newly hatched nonpoisonous snakes and there are those that even consume the snake eggs.

2. Butterflies Lizards love to eat these colorful creatures and therefore if your garden has plenty of butterflies you can be assured that the lizards will make them an endangered species.

3. Cockroaches Garden lizards eat roaches as though they were light snacks.

4. Their own eggs- At times when the hunger is too much, the lizard will opt to eat its own eggs.

5. Slugs They will use their teeth to have a grip then swallow the slug effortlessly since a slug is covered in a mucus-like membrane.

6. Small lizards- When they are roaming looking for females, the males will eat up other tiny lizards and do so to assert domination.

7. Fruits Garden lizards love fruits and especially berries. Succulent fruits also provide them with water. They also love bananas.

## # **What Do Small Garden Lizards Eat**

The bigger the lizard, the bigger its prey. Small lizards go for small prey such as flies and crickets and if they want more flesh they will go for spiders, snails, and caterpillars. **Do Garden Lizards Need Water** Yes, these lizards need water in order to survive and also maintain a healthy amount of moisture on their skin.

Garden lizards cannot live without water but at the same time, you should understand that they cannot thrive in places where there is excessive water.

They will drown and die. So water levels or amounts should be moderate. **Do They Have Teeth** Garden lizards possess teeth and these teeth are used for gripping their food not tearing it apart. The prey is then swallowed whole once its captured.

# # **Do Garden Lizards Eat Vegetables And Plants**

You might be led to think that garden lizards eat only meat but in some instances, they eat greens. **Do Garden Lizards Eat Flying Termites** Yes, garden lizards eat flying termites. When the termite flies near the lizard, the lizard simply opens its mouth and swallows the termite. Flying termites love to get a glimpse of light and normally fall down on the ground afterward. This makes it easier for the lizard to just gulp them up.

# # Where do Lizards live naturally?

First and foremost, garden lizards love warm weather hence the reason for their abundance in such climate areas. Secondly, they dwell in grass and trees. Water is essential for their wellbeing and so they live in places where they can have access to water and not become dehydrated. When the weather becomes cold, they will go missing in action and hide under rocks. **Are They Poisonous, Do They Bite** Garden lizards are harmless reptiles.

Yes, they are related to other poisonous reptiles but they are venom-free. These lizards do bite but as I said before, there is no poison. In fact, when these little fellows bite you, it looks like a small scratch, and a simple dressing will do. They never attack unless they feel they have to.

**How Do I Make My Garden, Lizard Friendly** The best thing about having the lizards in your garden is that they will eat up all the insects and larvae plus any mosquitoes that could be irritating you.

For the lizards to come or stay, you can do the following: - Plant native grasses - Do some mulching or leave behind some leaf cover - Plant some berries - Have a shallow bowl of water in the garden - If you have a cat, try as much as possible to keep it indoors lest it scares away the lizards - If you can then make a pond that will also attract insects and frogs. Throw in a ramp or stick so that the lizards can get out in case they jump in.

**What to avoid** - Avoid using pesticides or any other chemical solution - Do not rake the leaves - Do not capture lizards from the park. Garden lizards find their own habitat - Do not feed the lizards because they have to learn how to fend for themselves **Some Things To Note** A lizard cannot control its body temperature so it will be good if you can turn on the sprinklers during the hot summer holidays.

When you notice that their tails are down then something is wrong.

The lizard could be stressed or hurt by another animal. Again, keep your cat away from the lizard because the cat will make a snack out of it.

## # **Conclusion**

Garden lizards are creatures that simply love a low profile. They will eat all the bugs and cockroaches and be your constant companion in the garden. And as it is said, you are what you eat, and knowing what a lizard eats is the first step in truly knowing the garden lizard so that you can co-exist with them in a mutual manner.
