## LeafFilter Review
LeafFilter Gutter Protection is a prominent provider of **micro-mesh gutter guards**. Their system is designed to completely enclose your existing gutters, preventing any debris from entering. The core of their product is a surgical-grade (275-micron) stainless steel mesh, which is incredibly fine, capable of blocking even small particles like shingle grit, pollen, and pine needles.
This mesh is supported by a rigid uPVC (unplasticized polyvinyl chloride) frame, which is known for its durability and resistance to weathering.
The design features an 11-degree pitch, allowing water to flow through the mesh into the gutter while larger debris slides off. LeafFilter's system is installed on your existing gutters without disturbing your roof shingles, a key benefit for maintaining roof warranties. They focus exclusively on providing a high-quality gutter protection solution, aiming to make gutter cleaning a thing of the past for homeowners.

## Compare LeafFilter to Its Top Competitors
LeafFilter is a dominant force in the micro-mesh gutter guard market, often compared to other top-tier professional installers like MasterShield and Gutter Helmet.
* **Vs. MasterShield (Micro-Mesh Competitor):** * **Mesh & Frame:** Both use fine stainless steel micro-mesh. LeafFilter typically uses a uPVC frame, while MasterShield uses an aluminum frame. Some argue aluminum is more robust and less prone to warping due to temperature changes than uPVC, though LeafFilter's uPVC is designed for durability. * **Installation Angle:** MasterShield's key differentiator is its patented roof-pitch installation, designed to better shed debris.
LeafFilter has an 11-degree pitch built into its design, which is effective, but MasterShield claims a more aggressive angle for shedding. * **Self-Cleaning:** MasterShield often incorporates copper into its mesh for claimed self-cleaning properties against algae/moss. LeafFilter relies on the fineness of the mesh and shedding angle. * **Pricing & Warranty:** Both are premium-priced and offer strong lifetime transferable warranties.
* **Vs. Gutter Helmet (Reverse-Curve Competitor):** * **Design Philosophy:** These are fundamentally different systems. LeafFilter uses a micro-mesh to filter water, while Gutter Helmet uses a reverse-curve (or "hooded") design, relying on surface tension to direct water into the gutter while debris falls over the edge. * **Debris Handling:** LeafFilter's micro-mesh excels at blocking all debris, including tiny particles like pine needles and shingle grit.
Gutter Helmet is excellent for large leaves but can sometimes allow smaller debris to enter or cause water "overshoot" in heavy downpours or on steep roofs. Pine needles can also sometimes cling to the curved surface. * **Installation:** LeafFilter attaches to existing gutters without going under shingles. Gutter Helmet often slides under the first row of shingles, which some homeowners worry could impact roof warranties (though Gutter Helmet claims it does not).
* **Aesthetics:** LeafFilter has a relatively low profile. Gutter Helmet's hooded design is generally more visible from the ground.
LeafFilter is widely considered one of the most effective micro-mesh systems available, particularly for its ability to block even the finest debris. Its broad availability and strong warranty further bolster its market position.

## Cost of LeafFilter
LeafFilter is considered a premium gutter protection system, and its cost reflects the quality of materials, advanced design, and professional installation. The exact price for LeafFilter is not a standard per-foot rate and will vary based on several factors:
* **Linear Feet of Gutters:** The total length of gutters on your home is the primary cost determinant. * **Roof Height & Complexity:** Taller homes, multi-story residences, and homes with complex rooflines (more corners, valleys, dormers) require more labor, time, and specialized equipment, increasing the cost. * **Condition of Existing Gutters:** If significant repairs or a full replacement of your existing gutters are needed, this will add to the overall project cost.
* **Geographic Location:** Labor costs and regional market pricing can influence the final quote. * **Discounts & Promotions:** LeafFilter frequently offers various discounts (e.g., seasonal promotions, senior citizen, military discounts), which can significantly impact the final price.
Based on recent customer surveys and industry data, the installed cost of LeafFilter typically ranges from **$17 to $45 per linear foot**, with an average project cost between **$2,600 and $6,300** for a typical home with 150-200 linear feet of gutters. While this is a substantial investment, it's competitive with other top-tier, professionally installed micro-mesh systems.

## Reviews of LeafFilter
LeafFilter generally receives **highly positive customer reviews** across various reputable platforms like the Better Business Bureau (BBB), Trustpilot, and Google Reviews for local branches.
Common themes in positive feedback include:
* **Exceptional Effectiveness:** Customers consistently praise LeafFilter's ability to keep gutters completely clear of all types of debris, even in challenging environments with heavy tree cover or fine pine needles. * **Professional Installation:** The installation crews are frequently commended for their professionalism, efficiency, courtesy, and thorough cleanup.
* **Peace of Mind:** Many homeowners express significant relief at no longer having to worry about dangerous ladder climbing or costly gutter cleaning. * **Strong Warranty:** The lifetime transferable warranty is a major draw and provides confidence in the product's longevity.
Some common criticisms, while less frequent than positive comments, include:
* **Sales Tactics:** A small number of reviews mention initial high price quotes that are then significantly reduced after negotiation, which can be perceived as aggressive. * **Ice Dams:** Like most gutter guards that cover the gutter opening, LeafFilter can, in some extreme winter conditions, contribute to ice dam formation if attic insulation or ventilation is insufficient. LeafFilter's warranty explicitly states it does not cover damage from ice dams.
* **Minor Surface Maintenance:** While rare, some users in areas with heavy pollen or sap report needing to lightly rinse the mesh surface occasionally.
Despite these minor points, LeafFilter maintains an excellent overall reputation and high ratings from a vast customer base, reflecting a product that largely delivers on its promises.
