Bed bugs are notorious for being resilient pests that can infest your home without you even noticing. One of the most effective ways to eliminate them is by using [temperature](https://pestpolicy.com/at-what-temperature-do-fleas-die/)to your advantage. Bed bugs cant survive extreme temperatures, and applying either heat or cold is an effective strategy to eradicate them.

##  How Heat Can [Kill](https://pestpolicy.com/does-the-dryer-kill-fleas/)Bed Bugs

Bed bugs are sensitive to heat, and exposing them to temperatures above 113F (45C) for several minutes can kill them at all life stages, from eggs to adults. The heat needs to be sustained for at least 90 minutes to be effective, so using heat treatment methods like steam cleaning or using a heat chamber can be highly beneficial.

However, it is important to monitor the temperature carefully, as exceeding 120F (49C) can damage your furniture and belongings.

##  Cold Temperatures for Bed Bug Control

Cold temperatures are another effective way to kill bed bugs. Freezing bed bugs at temperatures below 0F (-18C) for several days will also kill them. Placing smaller items like bedding or clothing in the freezer for several days can be an effective method to eliminate these pests. However, freezing is generally less effective for larger items, such as furniture or mattresses, where heat treatments tend to be more efficient.

##  Why Temperature-Based Methods Work

Both heat and cold disrupt the physiological processes of bed bugs. When exposed to high heat, their proteins and enzymes begin to break down, and they are unable to survive. On the other hand, freezing temperatures can cause ice crystals to form in their bodies, leading to cellular damage and death. By understanding these principles, you can use temperature-based methods to help eliminate bed bugs from your home.

##  Tips for Using Temperature to Kill Bed Bugs

- **Use a professional heat treatment: **If you have a large infestation, hiring a professional pest control service that offers heat treatment may be necessary. They can apply the heat uniformly and safely to kill bed bugs. - **Monitor temperature levels: **Ensure that the temperature remains consistent for the required time when using heat treatments. Inadequate exposure time can lead to ineffective results.

- **Seal items before freezing: **If freezing items to kill bed bugs, make sure to place them in sealed plastic bags to prevent reinfestation from other sources. - **Combine methods: **A combination of heat, cold, and chemical treatments may be required for severe infestations.

##  Conclusion

Temperature treatments are an effective way to kill bed bugs and prevent future infestations. Whether you choose heat or cold, it is essential to understand how to apply these methods correctly. For severe cases, seeking professional pest control services is highly recommended to ensure thorough and lasting elimination of bed bugs from your home.
