##  Details: What do baby fleas look like?

###  1. Adult Fleas - and Flea Dirt

Adult fleas arise from their pupae and start finding a favorable host and start taking their blood meal from the cats, dogs, or even human beings. Fleas may live under carpets or bedding - including cat and dog bedding. Further, fleas could also drop some larvae, eggs, pupae, and their waste or poop. You'll notice some waste that's reddish-black, which they leave on the bedding.

Smearing the debris will make it turn rusty or reddish - proving that you genuinely have a flea infestation.

Examine the cat or dog's sleeping towel, rug, or bed - do you notice some "pepper or salt grain" looking objects? Then, these are flea larvae (salt grain") while the pepper is flea dirt. For a massive flea infestation, you should use flea foggers or hire some professional exterminators to kill adults, larvae, and baby fleas hiding under furniture and carpets - further practice regular vacuuming.

###  2. Flea Eggs

Adult fleas (that's the female fleas) lay about 27 eggs in 24 hours. Fleas eggs are off-white, smooth, and also dry - they'll stay mainly in the cat's or dog's bedding. So, briefly, fleas eggs have a soft shell plus some flexible-Chorio. They measure about 0. 5 mm by 0. 25 mm in length & width, respectively. Fleas eggs have a shape described as r *ounded-oval. * Fleas eggs are slippery and will slide on the cat's or dog's skin and fur.

You'll find eggs on the bedding of pets - fleas don't stay on humans. Flea eggs have a length of 0. 05 millimeters - the tiny bugs may be difficult to see with your naked eyes. Female fleas lay their eggs once they take a blood meal. In particular, cat flea will have a whitish or translucent-oval dots or sometimes dirt. They'll hatch within two days to 14 days - to become flea Larva.

###  3. Flea Pupae

Flea larvae have a silky cocoon that allowing better camouflaging with their surroundings. The outer shell is irregular, crusty, and lumpy. The larvae will molt (within three days to even one year) to become flea pupae - mainly once they sense carbon dioxide or vibrations from a pet host or humans. The development of the flea pupae will start at the 3rd & 4th larvae insta.

They'll spin cocoons from upholstery fabrics, furniture, carpets, dust, lint, and human hair.

The eyeless and legless pupa molts into a being that'll easily detect any warm-blooded animals. Also, it'll move fast and jumping very high onto the animal for a blood meal. Further, using IGR like Precor and Archer won't kill the flea pupae that are fully developed. However, IGRs will kill flea larvae and flea eggs.

The pupal casing or cocoon provides the necessary protection against the environment's harsh forces until when the conditions are favorable, like a host coming nearby.

###  4. Flea Larvae

Flea larvae, once developed, will come out of the flea eggs. They'll measure from 3 mm to 5 mm in length. The semi-transparent to white-colored worm-like larvae will become darker as they grow. [Flea larvae mainly eat flea dirt](https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-flea-larvae-eat/) - which makes them darken during growth.
