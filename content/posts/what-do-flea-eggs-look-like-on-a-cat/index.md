## Can You See Flea Eggs On A Cat?
There are particular places in your pet where fleas like to hide. These are also the same place that they lay their eggs and reproduce.
- The funny thing with fleas is that once they attach to one host, they hardly leave unless there are some external disturbances.
- If your pet is a cat, fleas prefer to hide between the shoulders and also on the backside of the neck.
- That way the cat is not able to disrupt them when grooming. If by chance they are disrupted, they jump off the host and return when it is safe for them. They have enough time to live on the host and reproduce till they die.
When the eggs are laid on the fur, they partially hang on the fur before they dry and fall off to the carpet, couch, and other surroundings. 70-80 % of eggs fall off from your pet and hatch on the ground before they can later look for a new host to continue with the other part of the flea life cycle.
What kills flea eggs on cats? When pests are grooming, most eggs fall. The itchiness from the bites also causes the eggs to fall.

## How Many Eggs Do Fleas Lay?
Where do fleas lay eggs? Fleas reproduce by laying eggs. When a female matures, it starts to lay eggs even if they are not fertilized. After mating, the female lays eggs that are fertile that hatch into fleas.
- A female flea can lay an average of 20-30 eggs in a day and an average of about 180 eggs per week when all the conditions are right.
- A flea has a life span of 60-100 days. With good feeding, fleas increase their fertility rate and can even lay up to 45 eggs in a day.
Their fertility is greatly enhanced by pet blood while human blood is less nutritious. This means that if there are no pets at home, the fleas lay fewer eggs translating to a smaller population of fleas.
## Summary
What do flea eggs look like on a cat? Flea eggs are small and shiny with their color ranging from translucent to a whitish color.
- These eggs are laid in the fur of the pets in your homes like cats and dogs. Fleaswill hide behind the neck, on the shoulders, and at the base of the tail to avoid disruption from the pets and humans.
- Fleas are more fertile and lay more eggs when they suck blood from cats and dogs than when they suck human blood. They are capable of laying up to 45 eggs in a day and 180 eggs in a week.
