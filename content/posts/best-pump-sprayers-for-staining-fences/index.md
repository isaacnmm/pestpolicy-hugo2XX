Using the best pump [sprayers](https: //pestpolicy. com/best-air-compressors-for-spray-painting/) for staining fences will be both less labor- and time-intensive compared to using a roller or brush. But the roller and roller trends push your painting material deeper into the wood.

You should stain or paint your wood fence ( [with exterior decking stain](https: //pestpolicy. com/[best](https: //pestpolicy. com/best-airless-paint-sprayer/)-stain-for-swing-set/) ) every 2-3 years as the wood will be exposed to many elements - and thus staining or painting will increase its durability. On quantity, you'll require one gallon of stain for painting smaller fences of roughly 175 square feet.

But you'll need about 2 to 4 gallons of stain to paint larger fences of a maximum of 700 square feet. But should you pressure wash your fence prior to painting? Well, YES, pressure-wash the fences to remove grime, dust, dirt, and old finish(es) as these may ultimately show through the stained surfaces.
