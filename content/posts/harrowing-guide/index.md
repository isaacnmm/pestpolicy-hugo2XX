What is harrowing? **Harrowing is further preparation of a seedbed that comes after plowing. Harrowing come with specialized attachments that help to break up large soil clumps. Many rookies confuse harrowing with cultivating as both are crucial in seedbed preparation. ** **However, plows dig deeper into the soil and in the process loosening and turning it.

Harrows, on the other hand, refine the already plowed ground reducing the size of the soil particles leaving it aerated correctly in readiness for planting. **

##  How To Do Harrowing (Land Preparation Guide)

Tractor harrows and hard soil tillers come in different sizes and shapes, with the common ones having tines, discs, or chains. The evolution of the harrowing machines has seen the manually animal pulled machines replaced by tractor-pulled harrows.

The leveling implements are usually robust and evenly spaced out. Dragging them implement leaves the topsoil refined and its recommended for use, especially on large scale farming.

##  **What Is The Difference Between Harrowing And Tilling?**

Many people, especially the inexperienced, will differentiate between plows and harrows when they see them. However, very few will tell you the difference in how they work as both works very closely. Tractors and other ATVs drag both, but they work differently in [seedbed preparation - tillers](https://pestpolicy.com/best-tiller-for-raised-beds/).

##  Why Harrow? - Reasons for Harrowing

Harrowing does more to the soil than reducing the size of soil particles, making it an essential process before seeding. The benefits include: **1. Removing Weeds from the Ground** After plowing, some grasses may get attached to the soil clamps. Harrows help remove the weeds by bringing them on the soil surface, making it easy for seeding. You can also manually collect the weed stumps leaving the seedbed ready for planting. **2.

Removing Soil Clumps** Plowing helps to disintegrate robust and compact grounds and turns it up the soil. However, the leveler breaks the soil clumps and sod by reducing their size further - [depending on the tiller or harrow width](http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=RU2012000341).

It also brings the clamps and sods that its unable to cut to the soil surface. In most cases, it breaks all, but in case of rocky soils, the rock particles are brought to the soil surface, making it easy for you in the seeding process. **3. Soil Aeration And Better Water Absorption** Harrowing your yard is crucial for better soil aeration. Soil microorganism thrives better in an adequately aerated soil.

In turn, they can break the humus in the ground better, making it more fertile.

The disc harrows are heavy and sturdy and are best suited for breaking bigger clumps compared to other types of levelers like the chain harrows.

- **Tine Harrows** Tine harrows are excellent when it comes to the final seedbed preparation before seeding. They are not as massive compared to disc harrows, making them ideal for lighter work. However, they are excellent at breaking the topsoil. As a result, its easier for the soil to absorb water. T adequately aerated in readiness for seeding. - **Chain Harrow** The versatility of the use of the chain harrow is dependent on its weight.

Look for harrowing implements that you can use after seeding. **d) Durability** A hard ground requires a sturdy harrow. You need to get a harrow with a strong structure for strength.

Ensure that the discs material is strong to withstand the harrowing through tough, compact soil. Many heat-treated disk blades are durable and ideal for use with tractor-pulled harrows. Harrows with thick discs are suitable for compacted soils and will work perfectly with different soil conditions.
