##  **How to Choose the Best Cordless Vacuum for Pet Hair**

You cannot inhibit your pets from shedding hair on your carpets, bare floor, and upholstery. - But you can keep your surfaces free from pet hair by acquiring a vacuum cleaner that is meant for pet hair. - If you dont know what to look for in a vacuum for pet hair, you have to the right place. **Suction Power** Your main aim is to have a powerful suction that will effectively dislodge pet hair from bare floors, deep carpets, and so on.

So, your device should pick up pet hair without leaving some of it behind. The motor rotation and battery power heavily determine the suction power. Currently, most vacuums come with special attachments that increase their ability to suck pet hair. **Roller Brush** A powered roller brush is the best tool for removing pet hair from carpets.

The brush bristle dislodges pet hair from the carpet fibers while the sucking mechanism pulls them for vacuuming.

Go for a device that automatically reduces the roller brush rotation on transitioning from carpet to hard or smooth surface. This ensures that the carpets collected from the carpet do not get blown away before it gets vacuumed. **Head Attachments** Since pet hair will be located in various places, youll need different vacuuming heads.

Therefore, apart from the brush roll, you need a tool for vacuuming your upholstery and a crevice tool for reaching difficult areas.

**Effective Filtration** Other than the hair, pets will shed off dander, which eventually brings in dust mites and their feces. Under these circumstances, you are likely to suffer from allergic reactions, especially when vacuuming your house. However, a vacuum with an effective filtration system will ensure that 99. 9% of allergens and pollutants are trapped. HEPA filters are usually recommended because of their effective filtration.

**Run-time** The choice of a cordless vacuum eliminates the inconvenience of a power cord trailing behind you. The presence of a rechargeable battery compensates for this. However, it wont be of many benefits if the battery has a very short run-time. Therefore, its advisable to go for a high-quality lithium-ion battery model to get a substantial run-time.

##  **Conclusion**

With numerous vacuum cleaners in the market today, it might be challenging to settle on one that is ideal for vacuuming pet hair. - But after going through this review and buyers guide, you should be in a position to pick your most ideal device.
