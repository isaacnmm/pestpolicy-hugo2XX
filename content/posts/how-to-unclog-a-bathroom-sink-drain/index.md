##  When Should you Call a Plumber?

Cleaning the showerhead could help fix your low water pressure head at times. However, the use of DIY methods such as vinegar and baking powder, hot water, or plunger may fail to attain quality results in some cases. So, its advisable to call a plumber if you encounter instances highlighted below:

###  i. A rapid burst pipe leak

A pipe or your water line may suffer a major burst causing gallons of water to flood all over your house. Though uncommon, this occasionally happens and when it does, calling a plumber is imminent. Not only that, but you also have to act promptly to temporarily stop the rapid leak before the plumber gets there. Locate the intermediary cut-off valves closest to the leak and stop the supply of water to the leaking line.

If you cant find any of the cut-off valves, then find and turn off the main water shut-off valve this will cut-off water supply to the entire house until a plumber rectifies the leak.

###  ii. No water supply in the house

In most cases of this problem, water stops flowing in one or several of the sub-water-lines in your house, for example, bathroom sink, kitchen, or shower. In very rare cases will you find a total stoppage of water supply to your house especially if you own an online water backup supply. It is recommendable to first inspect the affected water outlets and their subsections (those that are not receiving water).

For instance, due to a faulty water heater, hot water may not be delivered to your shower outlet despite the cold water supply being fully operational. Moreover, it is possible that the water supply has stopped because of a massive leak in the sunken pipe feeding your house water line from the street-side water meter.

###  iii. When you have a leak in the drainage line leak

Leaking kitchen and bathroom leaks are a common thing for homeowners its caused by excess internal pressure or pipe breakage. The leaking sink trap should be replaced ensure the water supply is turned off first.
