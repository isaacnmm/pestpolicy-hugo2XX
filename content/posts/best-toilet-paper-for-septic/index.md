##  Considerations for the Best Toilet Paper for Septic

**1. Breaking Ability and Ease to Dissolve. ** Ensure you select a toilet paper that can break rapidly into small pieces after use. - This makes it easier to be carried by flush water without blocking the septic system. - Besides, the broken pieces shoulddissolve easily in flush water from a liquidmixture. It is difficult to flush undissolved toilet paper. Moreover, these fibrous tissues will require extra Flush water to push them forward. **2.

Anti-clog type.

** Check if the toilet paper you intend to buy whether has anti-clog a property. Most low-quality tissue papers clog the toilet, sewer, and septic system affecting the entire network. What happens is that the broken tissue paper stick on the inner lining of the sewer pipes and septic, thus narrowing the passage.

The flush water cannot wash away these clogs since they form a hard substance that requires higher force (the ingredients for which these low-quality toilet papers are made from propagating the stick ability). **3. The Biodegradable ability. ** Any tissue should be biodegradable. This means that it should be in a position to be decomposed by bacteria found in the septic or sewer system at ease.

- This is very important as it will avoid pollution and the high accumulation of used toilet paper in the septic tank. Removal of undigested used toilet paper waste from the septic system is costly and time-consuming. Ensure you confirm the biodegradable label before purchasing any toilet paper brand. **4.

The Eco-friendly** The climate and environmental organizations encourage the use of products that do not pollute the environment during and after use.

Toilet papers, when dropped in the background, should naturally decompose and cause minimal pollution. - You should avoid purchasing tissue papers that take longer to decompose. The pulp used for toilet paper should be sourced from well-managed forests but not from recycled materials. Do your background study of any tissue paper producing company well before buying their product.

##  Don't Flush Down Septic Systems? Why?

You can achieve this by avoiding flushing some of these things: **1. Clothes and Sanitary towels. ** Usually, clothes do not decompose in septic tanks quickly. Though they may be of small size, their accumulation in the septic tank is disastrous. - Most sanitary towels do not decompose swiftly. Some of them are large and make it difficult to flow in sewer lines.

Together with clothes, sanitary towels mostly block the septic and sewer system leading to unnecessary maintenance costs. **2.

Plastics and Nylon products** Avoid flushing plastic and nylon products such as papers, condoms, pampers, and wrappers since they block the septic and sewer system and accumulate in the septic tank. It would be vital if you can make a notice at your home to warn users against flushing such substances. **3.

Chemicals** Don't wash/clean your septic and sewer system with chemicals (Sodium Hydroxide, Lye, caustic soda) that may be found in your houses, such as dish soap, drain cleaners, and powder cleaners. - Most of them contain substances that form foam in the septic tank. Avoid oily waste flush into your septic as it sticks on the inner wall causing a thick layer, which accumulates, thus narrowing the system network.

##  Conclusion

The right selection of toilet paper is key for the safety of your septic system. - Look for biodegradable, eco-friendly, chemical-free, rapid braking, and more comfortable dissolving properties when purchasing the best toilet paper for your septic. Avoid flushing plastic, nylon, and non-biodegradable products in your septic as a proper way of maintaining your septic and sewer system.
