While [carpenter](https://pestpolicy.com/compare-carpenter-bee-vs-bumblebee/)bees do not bite humans, they can cause damage to wooden structures. The bees burrow into wood to create their nests, which can lead to structural damage if left unchecked. Over time, repeated nesting activity can weaken wood, especially in areas like decks, eaves, and siding.

###  How to Prevent Carpenter [Bee](https://pestpolicy.com/hornet-bees-and-wasp-removal-tacoma/)Infestations

To prevent carpenter bees from nesting in your home or garden, consider the following methods: - **Seal Wooden Surfaces: **Ensure that wood around your home is sealed properly. Carpenter bees are attracted to untreated wood, so applying a coat of paint or varnish can deter them from drilling. - **Use Bee Traps: **Specialized carpenter bee traps can help reduce the number of bees around your property.

- **Regular Inspections: **Regularly inspect your wooden structures for signs of carpenter bee activity. Look for round holes and sawdust-like material near wood surfaces. - **Natural Repellents: **Some natural repellents, like citrus or essential oils, can be used to discourage carpenter bees from nesting in certain areas.

###  Conclusion

Carpenter bees are typically harmless to humans and do not bite. While their nesting behavior can cause damage to wood, they are not aggressive and will only sting if provoked. Taking preventive measures, such as sealing wood and using repellents, can help avoid infestations and minimize the risk of damage.
