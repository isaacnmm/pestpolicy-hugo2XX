##  Steps to Building A Barrel Train

###  Step 1: Gather Everything You Need For the Project

Youll need the following to start off - [55-gallon HDPE barrel](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y2H5GVX/?tag=p-policy-20)- [10-inch wagonwheels](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ECAVJ1I/?

To make a good decision consider the number of children that would ride on the train. Will adults join in too?

Other Important Tools and Supplies Include - Ratchets or wrenches for tightening the bolts or nuts - Wood-cutting saw - A jigsaw - A hand drill - 22-inch wood plunks - 2-1/2 inches wood screws

###  Step 2: Painting Your Barrels (Optional)

Barrels are usually white or blue in color. You may opt to paint them your favorite color or let them retain their original paint.

If youve decided on a different color, you can use spray paint and do several coats to attain the best look.

Allow the barrels to dry properly.

###  Step 3: Cut the Barrels

Flip the barrels to the side and cut the top according to your preference. Ensure the openings are large enough to accommodate both adults and children for uninterrupted and fun-filled family time.

###  Step 4 Building Frames

To prevent the sharp edges at the top from hurting the users, its good to create rectangular frames. You can attach these frames on top of the cut barrels.

The size of your barrel will determine the actual measurements of the frame. Ensure that the frame you create fits properly on the barrel.

Next, cut and weld two "V" shapes using the steel rods. Attach the cut rods on the frame opposite the hitch. Weld the hollow circular rod into the "V" shapes.

Next, youll need to fasten the barrel onto the frame. Thus, drill holes through the frame into the barrel and insert bolt and nuts then fasten them.

###  Step 5 Insert Wheels

Once youre through with constructing the frames, it's time to include the wheels.

I will encourage you to refer to this [website](https://howtoadult.com/trailer-plastic-barrels-4709116.html)- howtoadult. com for more detailed information.

Now, insert your wheel axel or steel dowel through the circular steel rod. Attach the wheels.

###  Step 6: Construct Seats (Optional)

You can opt to build seats for each barrel/cart. Although its an optional step, you can still put the seats for added comfort.

You can also include safety seat belts to keep the little ones safe while riding.

The seats dont have to be expensive. You can simply cut a fitting board and insert it inside the barrel. Add a cushion on top to enhance comfort.

You can add two seats or just one depending on the number of users that would ride on the backyard train.

###  Step 7 Attach the Carts

Weld the flat steel tongue onto the frame, then drill holes. Drill corresponding holes through the carts hitches and connect the frame with the cart.

Use a bolt to fasten them together nicely.

Next, you can attach the Golf Cart, ATV, or UTV for pulling the cart.

There you have it! A backyard train that you can ride anytime or any day without restrictions.
