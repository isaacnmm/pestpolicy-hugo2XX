## About Traditional Bathroom Medicine Cabinets
Before we dive into Kohler's innovation, let's consider the conventional medicine cabinet. Typically, these units come in two main forms: recessed (set into the wall) or surface-mounted (attached to the wall's surface). While they offer convenient, eye-level storage, they often suffer from several limitations:

* **Limited and Inefficient Storage:** Most traditional cabinets feature a few evenly spaced, fixed shelves. This design rarely accommodates the wide range of bottle heights and item sizes found in a typical bathroom. Taller bottles often don't fit, leading to wasted vertical space or items being stored horizontally, creating clutter. Shorter items get lost behind taller ones.

* **Shallow Depth:** Many older models are quite shallow, often around 3 to 4 inches deep, making it difficult to store anything beyond small bottles or tubes. Larger items often have to sit on the countertop, defeating the purpose of the cabinet. * **Dated Aesthetics:** Some traditional medicine cabinets can look bulky, "builder-grade," or simply outdated, impacting the overall visual appeal of a modern bathroom.
Frames can be chunky, and the overall design might not integrate seamlessly with contemporary dcor. * **Lack of Flexibility:** Once installed, the internal configuration is usually fixed. There's little room to adapt to changing storage needs. * **Mirror Limitations:** Often, the only mirror is on the exterior door, meaning when the cabinet is open, you lose your reflection, making it awkward for grooming tasks.

* **Installation Challenges:** While surface mount is easier, recessed cabinets require cutting into the wall, which can be a more involved and permanent alteration.
These limitations often lead homeowners to seek alternative storage solutions, such as open shelving or larger vanity drawers, potentially sacrificing the convenient, hidden storage that a medicine cabinet can provide.

## Built for Righties or Lefties
One subtle yet highly appreciated design feature of the Kohler Maxstow medicine cabinet is its inherent flexibility for door swing orientation. Understanding that bathroom layouts and personal preferences vary widely, Kohler engineered the Maxstow for easy adaptability, making it suitable for both right-handed and left-handed users, or simply to fit the specific constraints of your bathroom space.
**How it works:** The Maxstow cabinet is designed to be **reversible**. This means that during installation, you can choose whether the door hinges on the right side (for a left-hand swing) or on the left side (for a right-hand swing). This flexibility is typically achieved by designing the cabinet structure and the hinges in a way that allows the entire unit to be simply flipped upside down, or by having pre-drilled holes for hinge mounting on both sides of the cabinet frame.
**Why this matters:** * **User Preference:** A right-handed person might prefer a right-hand swing door (hinged on the left) so they can open the cabinet with their left hand while grabbing items with their dominant right hand. Conversely, a left-handed person might prefer a left-hand swing (hinged on the right). * **Bathroom Layout:** The direction a door swings can significantly impact usability, especially in smaller bathrooms.
You might need the door to swing away from a vanity, a toilet, or another cabinet to allow for full access without obstruction. The reversible design ensures the cabinet fits seamlessly into various layouts. * **Future Adaptability:** If you ever remodel or reconfigure your bathroom, or if new occupants have different preferences, the cabinet can be re-installed with the opposite door swing without needing to purchase a new unit.
This simple yet effective design choice underscores Kohler's commitment to user-friendly products that offer practical solutions and adaptability, a hallmark of thoughtful modern design.

For decades, the [bathroom](https://pestpolicy.com/a-tour-of-chelseas-hall-bathroom-renovation/)medicine cabinet has been a utilitarian staple a simple mirrored box above the sink, designed for quick access to everyday essentials. While functional, many traditional models have been criticized for their limited storage, clunky design, and often, an inability to truly meet the diverse needs of modern households.

Enter [Kohler](https://pestpolicy.com/kohler-extra-tall-highline-arc-toilet/),a brand synonymous with quality bathroom fixtures, which has taken a fresh look at this humble cabinet with its innovative Maxstow model, aiming to revolutionize how we store and access our bathroom necessities.

##  How Kohler Revolutionized the Bathroom Medicine Cabinet

Kohler's Maxstow medicine cabinet line directly addresses these common pain points, rethinking the internal organization and overall design to maximize utility without compromising aesthetics. Their "revolution" lies in smart, user-centric engineering.

**Key Innovations of the Maxstow Model: **

1. **Innovative Staggered Shelving: ** This is perhaps the most significant departure from traditional designs. Instead of uniformly spaced shelves, Maxstow cabinets feature a combination of full-width and partial-width shelves at varying heights.

This ingenious layout allows you to store both tall items (like electric toothbrushes, hairsprays, or tall lotions) and shorter items (like contact lens cases, dental floss, or small jars) without wasted space.

No more tilting bottles or squishing items! 2. **Slim Profile, Maximized Internal Space: ** Despite being noticeably slimmer than many traditional cabinets (often around 3. 5 inches deep compared to 5 inches), the Maxstow manages to offer comparable or even *more* usable internal storage volume. This low-profile design allows the cabinet to hug the wall for a sleek, clean look, reducing how much it projects into the room. 3.

**Mirrored Interior: ** Maxstow cabinets typically feature mirrors not just on the exterior of the door, but also on the inside of the door and the back panel of the cabinet itself. This means you maintain a reflection even when the cabinet is open, which is incredibly convenient for grooming, applying makeup, or grabbing items while still seeing yourself. 4.

**Integrated Lighting (on select models): ** Many Maxstow models come with side-integrated LED lighting.

This eliminates the need for separate sconce lighting and provides optimally bright, even illumination for grooming tasks, reducing harsh shadows and hot spots. The quality of light (often 3000 Kelvin and high CRI) is designed to render colors accurately. 5. **Internal Electrical Outlets: ** Some lighted Maxstow cabinets include interior electrical outlets.

This is a game-changer for charging electric toothbrushes, shavers, or other small devices *inside* the cabinet, keeping your countertop clear of clutter and tangled cords. 6. **Durable Construction: ** Made from rust-proof aluminum, these cabinets are built to withstand the humid bathroom environment, ensuring longevity. 7.

**Easy Installation: ** Designed primarily for surface-mount installation, they eliminate the need for complicated wall cutting.

They typically screw directly to the wall, making DIY installation feasible for many homeowners. 8. **Soft-Close Hinges: ** For a touch of luxury and to prevent slamming, the doors often feature two-way adjustable hinges with a wide 108 opening capability and a soft-close mechanism.

By addressing the core issues of storage, aesthetics, and usability, Kohler's Maxstow line elevates the humble medicine cabinet from a mere storage unit to a thoughtfully designed piece of bathroom furniture that genuinely enhances daily routines.
