Can you drink alkaline [water](https://pestpolicy.com/best-water-tables-for-1-year-old/)every day? Alkaline water contains a pH that's higher than 7 - regular tap water has a pH of between 6. 5 to 8. 5 on the pH scale - [according to EPA](https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/drinking-water-regulations-and-contaminants).

On the health benefit claims, alkaline water is considered that its high hydrogen content allows better hydration compared to pure water, particularly during a workout. So, in summary, YES and NO - there are both benefits and cons of alkaline water on daily intake - leading to [clear skin](https://twitter.com/_AyeVee/status/1085823220157054976)and weight loss and reduce cancer. So, begin with a moderate intake of alkaline water.

Likely effects of excessive consumption of alkaline water include skin irritations, nausea, and gastrointestinal problems.

##  Can You Drink Alkaline Water every day?? 7 Pros

Using water made from one of the [best alkaline water pitchers](https://upurifywater.com/best-alkaline-water-pitcher/)reduces bone loss, improves digestion, reduces acid in the blood, slow the aging process, increase your energy, and helps improve metabolism.

###  1. Cuts diabetes and Blood pressure

[Researchers report](http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-SHYI200112005.htm)that within a year of taking alkaline water, human beings show reduced levels of blood lipids, blood sugar, and blood pressure. They'll reduce the blood viscositystickiness plus thickness. The alkaline water has a high pH electrolyte, and it was shown to reduce blood viscosity following workout (from de-hydration), and this cut cardiovascular strain.

Alkaline water produces better urine pH effect - particularly in the anaerobic test, plus the increased hydration allows one to increase their energy for your skeleton. Therefore, regular or daily intake of alkaline water will significantly improve your nutrition as it affects your body's hydration, plus the balance in the acid-base.

###  2. Reduces Osteoporosis and Improves Bone health

Scientists have noted that alkaline water will lead to benefits including [osteoporosis plus better bone health](http://www.thebonejournal.com/article/S8756-3282(08)00781-3/abstract)as it reduces bone resorption causing better bone regeneration. High mineral density plus less bone resorption makes your bones to gain more strength. The calcium and bicarbonate in the alkali water enhance better bone growth.

Alkaline water reduces the occurrence of osteoporosis - a condition that would otherwise make your bones brittle and highly brittle. Further, taking alkaline water was [noted to cause](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3195546/)lower levels of calcium in the human urine - but the research didn't prove a reduction in osteoporosis or better bone health.

###  3. Reduces Acid reflux

Acid reflux will happen if the acidic food content in your stomach - and these will splash into your food pipe, causing GERD - gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, [recent research](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/000348941212100702)discovered that alkaline water reduces the occurrence of GERD caused by acidic reflux of food into your food pipe.

Notably, the pH above 7 in the alkaline water prevents the progression of the activities of the enzymes, causing acid reflux or GERD.

Also, alkaline water contributes to the reduction of the acidity in the stomach and its contents. However, taking excessive alkaline water may prevent killing or pathogens like bacteria.

###  4. Increases Longevity

Research done on mice talking alkaline water over three years showed that they had improved longevity - living longer and further aging at a lower rate. Results from an analysis of the mice's brains, livers, hearts, intestines, and kidneys, demonstrated that the bugs experienced no danger of diseases due to taking alkaline water.

Further, on cancer, [research showed](http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/6/e010438.full)that there was a reduced risk (in mice) of getting urinary bladder cancer after taking alkaline water. However, some studies show that drinking alkaline water [could promote](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3195546/)a better update of chemotherapy medication for humans with cancer.

##  Alkaline Water vs. Plain Water

Many people consider that plain water more suitable for their health as compared to drinking alkaline water. This is mainly because of fear that alkaline water would neutralize their's blood acid. However, as noted above, moderate drinking of alkaline water will reduce the chances of getting heart disease, high blood pressure, or even cancer.

##  Conclusion

So, it's safe to drink alkaline water eat and every day as it has different health benefits, including reduces chances of getting high blood pressure, cancer, or diabetes. However, avoid excessive intake of the water because it might lead to neutralization of blood acid or the acidic level of the contents in your stomach - so begin the drinking with low intake and aim to increase the intake slowly.

Excessive intake of alkaline water may lead to skin irritations or gastrointestinal problems.

This is because of a disturbance of the normal pH of your body, causing eventual nausea.
