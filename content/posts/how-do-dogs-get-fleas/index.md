##  Details: How Do Dogs Get Fleas?

###  1. Dogs Can Get Fleas From Wild Animals

Despite that, you may be keeping your dogs in a domesticated way and they're the only pets using the yard, fleas may still jump onto them from wild critters like rabbits, deer, and squirrels. - Dogs could pick up those fleas when they come into contact with various wild animals; this is because they're sociable animals that'll move around the yards, parks, or even come near various pets.

You'll notice that dogs will wander in areas where wild animals that carry fleas are equally frequent.

In the backyard or during their daily walk dogs will get into contact with animals such as deer, raccoons, rodents, squirrels, rabbits, and birds. Thus as the dogs take social activities, they may contact fleas via contact with the wild animals. Notably, fleas will jump onto dogs or humans and get carried to other locations where they'll build up their colony.

####  Preventing Dogs from Getting Fleas and Ticks from Wild Animals

To prevent fleas from jumping onto dogs from the wild animals, it's important to hinder the wildlife from getting into your backyard or garden. - While at it, ensure to remove all objects or things that may attract the wild animals such as seeds, nuts, and other dogs.

Fleas have back legs that are very strong that'll allow them to jump onto the tail or body of the dog from other domestic pets that are in the house or backyard. Dogs will also get fleas from grass - fleas will jump onto the dog and suck its blood - and then they'll jump off back to the grass waiting for other hosts.

- You may notice that the dog is spending hours scratching themselves around the yard - maybe after picking those fleas from the grass or other pets.

Also, I recommend that you vacuum the carpets and other such flooring materials to remove all the flea stages - and ultimately dispose of that dangerous vacuum bag. - I also advise you to steam clean the floor and carpet to help kill those flea larvae.

##  3.**Pet Service facilities**

Dogs may also get flea some pets' facilities; these may include boarding kennels, grooming facilities, and dog's daycare facilities. - Thus, dogs may stick fleas from these facilities even with the strict flea-free regulations and rules being adhered to strictly. For example, dogs may also get fleas from the facilities of the pet groomer - fleas may hike the pet and come reproduce fast in your house, pet house, or yard.

- In addition, fleas could also have jumped onto the groomer's clothes and gear that have become flea-infected. So, ensure that the service provider in the pet care facility adheres strictly to all pest prevention protocols as this may guarantee that the dog is protected from fleas. Further, check how the pet service facility responds or helps whenever a bug infection is found in any other pets that are attended there.

Treating the dogs and the surrounding off fleas will be an appropriate step to undertake for prevention and control of those blood-suckers. - An appropriate and initial step that you must take is to flea-treat the dog using a suitable flea shampoo - especially one that's prescribed for the age of your dog.

Use a flea comb that is fine-toothed for dogs that have long hair as this will help remove the fleas, their eggs, and also flea dirt from the fur.

- Additional flea treatment that you may use must be approved or prescribed by the veterinarian - and these must control all fleas in various life stages including larvae and adult fleas.
