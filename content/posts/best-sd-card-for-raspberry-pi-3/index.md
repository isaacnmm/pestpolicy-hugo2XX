After using different Raspberry Pi SD cards, I have to say that the Best SD card for Raspberry Pi 3 must have excellent 4K random read and 4K random write, and [wear-leveling algorithms](https://www.delkin. com/blog/learning-the-basics-about-ssd-wear-leveling-algorithms/).

- I recommend the[Samsung Evo+32 GB](https://www.amazon. com/dp/B00WR4IJBE/? tag=p-policy-20)(with[*wear-leveling*](http://en.wikipedia. org/wiki/Wear_leveling))for their high4K random read (8. 58MB/sec) and 4K random write (3. 12 MB/sec), and excellentwear leveling. With excellent wear leveling and [proper SD card formatting](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-format-sd-card-to-fat32/), writing on your Raspberry Pi SD card will be distributed and hence last longer.

##  **7 Best SD card for Raspberry Pi 3**

###  [1. SanDisk Extreme-PRO 32GB](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NUB3530/?tag=p-policy-20)

Second and Third places on raspberry pi sd card (based on 4K random read and write) go to SanDisk Extreme MicroSD card & Samsung Pro+, respectively, but will cost you more than the Samsung Evo+. S anDisk Extreme Pro 64GB UHS-I i s approved by the microSD cards Benchmarks for your Raspberry Pi. With the SanDisk Extreme-PRO, you will get reliability and excellent performance in your Raspberry Pi3.

You can quickly recover your data using the RescuePRO Deluxe software after any accidental deletion happens.

The raspberry pi sd card allows about 17. 40MB/s write speed that will enhance your video shooting and play speed. Therefore, the card will improve continuous and fast burst-mode taking or photographs. Further, the in-depth analysis "Comparison table for Raspberry Pi microSD card" by Jeff Geerling approves the Samsung Evo+ 32GB on Amazon.

Ultimate Pi3 SD card: Y ou can also consider the Official Raspberry Pi 16GB SD Card, as it cl osely follows the Evo+ and the SanDisk Extreme models.

The pros are: (1) Highly Durable for bad conditions (2) Excellent performance (3) Top Endurance and reliability since it has wear leveling (4) Works with various SDHC UHS-I and SDHC operating gadgets. The only con is: (1) Relatively pricey.

###  [2. Samsung Evo+ 32 GB Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WR4IJBE/?tag=p-policy-20)

4K random read and 4K random write are significant performance factors for the Raspberry Pi SD card. Therefore, Samsung Evo+ tops the list at its values are 8. 58 MB/sec and 3. 12 MB/sec respectively. I ts also a great performer for projects, music, mobile gaming, and HD video recording. Samsung Evo+ 32GB, with 16MB/s dd, write speeds. It can endure a high of 85 Celsius and a low of -25 Celsius.

The SD card is highly resistant to Magnetic fields, X-Radiation, and Water.

**Dd Write Speeds: ** Using an IOMeter, I noted that Samsung Evo+ achieved 13. 0MB/s - 16MB/s dd write speed and 43. 6MB/s read speed. It is faster in handling small block sizes and files compared to DS cards like Samsung Pro, whic h is excellent for Raspberry Pi3. Samsung EVO+ has a fantastic exterior design, with an orange and white color theme. With the EVO+, you'll achieve top data transfer speeds reaching 80MB/s.

The Pros are: (1) Top performance high random write and read speeds (2) Work well with [**Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi 2models**](https://pestpolicy.com/[raspberry-pi-3](https://pestpolicy.com/best-pcie-wireless-card-for-gaming/)-vs-2/). (4) Reliable and cheap SD [card](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-format-sd-card-to-fat32/)(5) Working temperature is -13F - 185F.

Also, JeffGeerling recommends the above Samsung Evo+on his [Midwestern Mac](http://www.midwesternmac. com/blogs/jeff-geerling/raspberry-pi-microsd-card) guide. The SD cards also work well with Raspberry Pi model 3 B+, Raspberry Pi 1 (A+ & B+), Pi 2 Model B, Pi Zero, Pi Zero W, Pi 3 (B & B+).

Ire-did various benchmarks forSanDisk andSamsungcards (equally, I skipped the Lexar, Toshiba, and Sony due to slow speed while used in Raspberry Pi).

###  [3. SanDisk Ultra SDSQUNB**for Raspberry Pi 3**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010NE3U2M/?tag=p-policy-20)

This SanDisk Ultra Card has a capacity of 16 GB and is a class 10. Further, the company upgraded the speed of its previous cards, and thus this one has a 48 MB/s read speed.

Due to its high quality and read speeds, SanDisk Ultra is highly suitable for Raspberry Pi3 and other supercomputers.

But what is unique about the "ultra" design? - Well, small size (ultra) allows the SanDisk Ultra to consume much less power. - Also, the card is both shock, temperature, and X-Radiation proof. - Also, you'll not experience any stuttering or dropouts when using the SanDisk Ultra Micro SDHC card. Some people consider Raspberry Pi Official as the top Raspberry Pi 3 SD Card. But, what is better than a recommended product?

Then, the Raspberry Pi Official Card should be your first consideration in this class.

It has preinstalled Noobs, which will have the official Raspbian distribution. Further, it allows other operating systems that you can download and install from the internet.

Luckily, it's a Class 10 raspberry pi sd card, achieving top data transfer speeds, and will work with all the makes for Raspberry Pi.

###  [4. 32 GB Samsung EVO Micro SD**for Raspberry Pi 3**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XWMQ81P/?tag=p-policy-20)

It has a UHS-I interface that is fitting and will perform excellently with the camera. Also, with the Class 10 Micro SD Card and the UHS-I, you'll achieve high transfer speeds reaching 47MB/s.

With its attractive, orange, and white color scheme, Samsung has designed an excellent exterior look for the 32GB EVO Micro SDHC SD card.

The SD card is created for the positively mainstream section of consumers, ones that require excellent performance for their premium gadgets.

If you are worried about damaging the SD card, you should note that it 32GB EVO Micro SDHC SD card is temperature, X-Radiation, magnet, shock, and water-resistant.

###  [5. Raspberry Pi 16GB (NOOBS - Preloaded)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H5ZNOYG/?tag=p-policy-20)

Raspberry pi sd card is described as the official copy of the 16GB SD Card that comes with Preloaded NOOBS that will allow you to install the various Pi OS to the Raspberry Pi board.

The SD card has a 16GB SanDisk with an adapter. On booting Raspberry Pi using NOOBS, you can utilize the menu to install Raspian. Further, you can employ the internet to install other operating systems.

You can use the SD card slot on the converter (MicroSD to SD card).

Also, the SD card has the High-Speed and the Class 10 that allow faster data rates (transfer).

Interestingly, the SD Card will support multiple Operating Systems. The SD adapter will protect the SD Card after you eject it from your Raspberry Pi.

The EVO Class 10 SDHC SD card allows a high-speed transfer of photos and videos. Like, the 32GB EVO Micro SDHC SD card, this card is also temperature, X-Radiation, magnet, shock, and water-resistant.

The SD card allows full HD video taking, storage, and transfer. Further, the SD resists magnetic force produced by your speakers about 13 times when compares to normal SD cards.

Pros: - Allows plug and play operation with the installed software - You'll get an AD adapter and a MiCRO SD card having preloaded NOOBS. - Will work with all the models of Raspberry Boards - Fast write and read speeds with the Class 10 Micro SD Cons: - None

###  [6. 32GB LoveRPi Raspbian UHS-I MicroSD Card](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J56UIYM/?tag=p-policy-20)

32GB LoveRPi MicroSD Card is highly optimized for raspberry PI3: Particularly for the Pi Zero and the Pi3 B. Raspberry Pi will utilize the SD card like its hard drive.

The card is UHS-I and thus will be fitting with Raspberry Pi3 model B.

Therefore, you should aim to acquire a class 10 Micro SD card. Through the use of fast flash memory and controller, the LoveRPi MicroSD card will give you excellent performance compared to other cards, even the 32GB cards.

However, remember to get a Disk Management utility (diskmgmt. msc) while viewing your card (SD) for windows, a failure to which it'll only display 56MB caused by the Linux Distribution partition. **Fast transfer speeds** Being a class 10 and UHS-I card, the 32GB LoveRPi will give you fast data and file transfer speeds. Being a class 10 card, it will allow you to transfer data quickly, including video.

Also, the manufacturer provides a lifetime warranty for readability and write-ability. **32GB storage capacity** The storage capacity is large enough for both the raspberry OS and leaves space for other siles such as data and your critical applications.

##  Conclusion

Just like the 32GB LoveRPi MicroSD Card, the LoveRPi 128GB Raspbian SD card is optimized for RASPBERRY PI3, particularly Pi Zero and the other Pi3 B. - The card has a Raspbian OS and NOOBS loader but lacks RPi-Tracker software. Equally, the LoveRPi 128GB SD card is highly efficient since it incorporates a modern and fast flash memory and excellent controllers.
