# # Benefits of Using Emerald Urethane on Cabinets

Here are the main reasons why Emerald Urethane is an excellent choice for painting cabinets:

## # 1. Long-Lasting Finish

The urethane formula offers a durable finish that can withstand everyday wear and tear, making it a great option for cabinets that are used frequently. The paint resists chipping, cracking, and fading over time, maintaining the cabinets appearance for years.

## # 2. Smooth Application

One of the standout features of Emerald Urethane is its smooth application. It flows on easily, providing a flawless, even finish without brush marks. Whether you use a brush, roller, or spray gun, this paint delivers a professional-quality result.

## # 3. Low VOC and Low Odor

Emerald Urethane has low levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and minimal odor. This makes it more pleasant to work with, especially in closed spaces like kitchens or bathrooms. The low odor means that you wont have to deal with overwhelming fumes during or after application.

## # 4. Quick Drying and Recoat Time

Unlike some other paints that require long drying times, Emerald Urethane dries quickly, allowing you to apply a second coat in as little as 1 to 2 hours. This is a huge advantage for projects that need to be completed in a timely manner.

# # Drawbacks of Using Emerald Urethane

While there are many positives to this product, there are a few potential drawbacks to consider:

## # 1. Price

Sherwin Williams Emerald Urethane is a premium product, which means it is priced higher than some other cabinet paints. However, its durability and superior finish can justify the higher cost for many homeowners and professionals.

## # 2. Requires Proper Surface Preparation

For the best results, you must properly prepare the surface before applying Emerald Urethane. This includes sanding, cleaning, and priming the cabinets. While this is standard for most cabinet painting projects, it does add time and effort to the process.

# # How Does Sherwin Williams Emerald Urethane Compare to Other Cabinet Paints?

When compared to other cabinet paints, Emerald Urethane stands out for its durability and smooth finish. Lets take a look at how it stacks up against a few competitors: - **Benjamin Moore Advance: **Like Emerald Urethane, Benjamin Moore Advance is a popular choice for cabinet painting due to its smooth application and durability. However, Advance has a longer drying time and a stronger odor, which may not be ideal for indoor projects.

- **Behr Premium Plus Ultra: **Behrs cabinet paint is more affordable but doesnt provide the same level of durability and smooth finish as Emerald Urethane. It may require more coats for proper coverage. - **Rust-Oleum Cabinet Transformations: **Rust-Oleum offers a popular cabinet transformation kit that includes everything needed for refinishing.

While effective, it doesnt have the same sleek finish as Emerald Urethane and can be more labor-intensive.

# # Tips for Using Sherwin Williams Emerald Urethane on Cabinets

To get the best results when using Emerald Urethane on cabinets, consider these tips: - **Properly Prep the Surface: **Clean and sand the cabinets thoroughly before painting. Use a deglosser if needed, especially for glossy or varnished surfaces. - **Apply Thin Coats: **Apply multiple thin coats of paint for the best finish. Avoid thick layers, as this can cause drips and uneven texture.

- **Use a High-Quality Brush or Sprayer: **For the smoothest application, use a high-quality brush or sprayer.

A foam roller can also work well for larger areas. - **Allow Adequate Drying Time: **Let each coat dry completely before applying the next one. This ensures a solid, durable finish.

# # Conclusion

Overall, Sherwin Williams Emerald Urethane is an excellent choice for anyone looking to give their cabinets a high-quality, long-lasting finish. With its smooth application, fast drying time, and durable result, it is well worth the investment for both DIY homeowners and professional painters.

While it does require proper surface preparation and comes at a higher price point, the final result is a beautiful, professional-looking cabinet finish that will last for years to come.
