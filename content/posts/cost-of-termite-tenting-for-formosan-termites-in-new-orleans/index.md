For homeowners in New Orleans, the threat of Formosan termites is not a matter of if, but when. These aggressive, subterranean termites thrive in our warm, humid climate and can cause catastrophic structural damage with alarming speed. When a mature infestation is discovered, the required solution is almost always whole-home fumigation, or "tenting."

Understanding the cost of this essential service can be confusing, as it's not a simple flat fee. **The cost of termite tenting in the New Orleans area is primarily calculated based on the total volume of your home, measured in cubic feet.** This guide will break down the average costs, explain the key factors that will influence your final quote, and clarify why this method is the gold standard for controlling Formosan termites.

### Average Cost Breakdown

While every home is different, you can use these industry averages to create a reliable estimate.

*   **Cost per Square Foot:** This is an easier starting point for homeowners. The price generally ranges from **$1.50 to $4.00 per square foot** of your home's total footprint.
*   **Cost per Cubic Foot:** This is how the fumigation company calculates the amount of fumigant gas needed. The price typically falls between **$0.15 and $0.50 per cubic foot.**

**Example Cost Scenarios for a New Orleans Home:**

*   A smaller, 1,500 sq. ft. single-story home might cost between **$2,250 and $6,000.**
*   A larger, 2,500 sq. ft. two-story home could range from **$3,750 to $10,000 or more.**

### Key Factors That Influence Your Final Quote

Your home's square footage is just the starting point. These factors will directly impact the final price you pay.

1.  **The Type of Foundation:** This is a major factor in New Orleans. Homes built on a concrete slab are simpler to seal than historic homes raised on piers. A raised foundation requires significantly more labor to create a proper seal at the ground level, which will increase the cost.
2.  **The Complexity of Your Roofline:** A simple gable roof is much easier and faster to tent than a complex roof with multiple dormers, gables, and peaks. More complexity means more labor and materials.
3.  **Linear Footage:** While cubic footage determines the amount of gas, the total linear footage (the perimeter of your home) helps determine the labor cost. Larger homes simply require more work to prepare and seal.
4.  **Attached Structures:** An attached garage, a large covered patio, or a carport that is tied into the roofline must also be included under the tent, increasing the total volume and cost.

### Why Tenting is The Gold Standard for Formosan Termites

For a widespread or multi-colony Formosan termite infestation, tenting is the only method that can guarantee 100% elimination within the structure.

*   **It's Comprehensive:** The fumigant gas penetrates every single void in your home—inside the walls, in the attic, and through every piece of wood—killing all termites on contact. Liquid spot treatments can't reach all of these hidden areas.
*   **It's Necessary for Aerial Colonies:** Unlike other subterranean termites, Formosan termites have the unique ability to establish secondary "aerial" nests in your attic or walls, completely disconnected from the ground, as long as they have a moisture source (like a roof leak). Tenting is the only way to kill these hidden nests.

### FAQ

**Q: Does the cost of tenting include repairs for the termite damage?**
A: No. The fumigation cost is strictly for the treatment to eliminate the termite colony. The cost to repair any damaged wood is a separate expense and will need to be quoted by a licensed contractor.

**Q: Does tenting prevent termites from coming back?**
A: No. Tenting kills the termites currently inside your house, but it provides no residual protection. Once the tent is removed and the gas dissipates, your home is vulnerable again. That is why tenting is almost always paired with a secondary preventative treatment, like a liquid soil treatment or the installation of a baiting system, and an ongoing service contract to protect against future invasions.

**Q: What do I need to do to prepare my house for tenting?**
A: Your fumigation company will provide you with a detailed checklist. You will need to remove all living things (people, pets, plants), any food and medicine that is not in a sealed can or glass jar, and make arrangements to be out of the house for approximately 2-3 days.
