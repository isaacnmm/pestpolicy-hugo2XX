Fleas have four different stages during their life cycle-life-cycle/): - Eggs, - Larva, - Pupa, and - Adult. A cat flea can hatch about 2, 000 eggs [**in her lifetime**](https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/cornell-feline-health-center/health-information/feline-health-topics/fleas-source-torment-your-cat).
