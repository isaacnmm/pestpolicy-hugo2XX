Treating bed bug bites can become a problem if you dont act on them promptly.

Though hardly noticeable at first, these bites end up becoming irritable and embarrassing scars. So, how can you treat bed bug bite scars?
**In summary, to get [rid](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-get-rid-of-bed-bugs-fast/) of [bed](https://pestpolicy.com/are-bed-bug-eggs-hard-or-soft/) bug bite scars, use (1) over-the-counter medications like corticosteroid creams and lotions, retinoid creams, Mederma advanced scar gel, vitamin E oil or (2) home remedies like baking soda, aloe Vera gel, and lemon juice.**
## Use Over-The-Counter Medications
Wash the skin area with an antiseptic soap and clean water. This will help reduce the itching and also prevent occurrence of a skin infection.
### 1. Corticosteroid creams and lotions
Corticosteroid creams and lotions have antipruritic properties that make them potent remedies for skin allergy and itchiness.
They reduce histamine release to the areas that have been bitten by bed bugs, thus minimizing inflammation and itching. One of the best corticosteroid cream in the market is Cortizone 10 Maximum Strength.
*Directions for use:*
- Wash the affected area with cool water and allow it to dry naturally
- Apply a thin layer of the cream and massage gently until it disappears
- Do not exceed 1-2 applications in a day
- If you are using other skin treatments, allow about 30 minutes before applying to avoid them mixing on your skin
- It is also advisable not to use the cream for more than 3 days since it can get absorbed into the bloodstream
### 2. Retinoid creams
Retinoid creams can be used to reduce scarring and improve the appearance of scars from bed bug bites. Retinoids are not meant to treat the scars, but to diminish them. I recommend using Retinol Serum.
*Directions for use:*
- Wash your skin with clean water and soap
- Allow your skin to dry completely. Damp skin allows retinol to be absorbed deeper into the skin, leading to irritation.
- Apply the retinol serum using your fingertips.
- Add a broad-spectrum sunscreen if the skin is to be exposed to direct sunlight.
### 3. Mederma Advanced Scar Gel
Mederma gel can be used to enhance the appearance of bed bug scars by making them soft and improving their texture. This gel also protects the scars from the damaging effects of UV rays, making them to heal quickly.
*Directions for use:*
- For new scars apply the gel once every day for eight weeks
- For existing scars, apply the gel once every day for 3-6 month
- Do not use the gel on fresh bed bug bites- wait until the bites have closed up
- Also do not use it on children below 6 months old
### 4. Vitamin E Oil
Vitamin E has been proven to be a potent remedy for skin rejuvenation. When applied to a bed bug scar, vitamin E cream will promote skin healing, thus reducing the scarring.
*Directions for use:*
- Clean the scar thoroughly to remove oils and bacteria

- Dab the oil on the scar lightly without rubbing
- Do not touch or spill the oil on clothing.
- If you have to cover the wound, let it be for a while, to avoid trapping bacteria and fungus.
- Allow 4-5 hours and wash within 8 hours
- Use Vitamin E oil once every day until your scars disappear
### 5. Witch Hazel
Witch Hazel contains natural Salicylic Acid which has a drying effect on scars. When used on bed bug scars, this natural remedy will disinfect them and promote the healing and scar reduction process. It is enhanced with Aloe Vera for soothing and easing the itchiness.
*Directions for use:*
- Wash the affected skin thoroughly and allow to dry
- Test the sensitivity of your skin on a small portion of your skin. You know that your skin is sensitive if theres irritation, redness or rashes. Do not use witch hazel if you have a reaction

- How to Identify Bed Bug Bites
Although bed bug bites resemble those of other insects, it is possible to distinguish them using the following observations.
Bed bug bites exhibit a unique pattern. They appear in straight lines or zigzag.
Bed bugs like to attack the exposed parts such as hands, neck shoulders, arms, legs and face. The bites appear as either flat or raised, inflamed, itchy, blistered or red areas on the skin.
Bed bug bites can take as little as a few hours to as much as a whole week to appear on the skin.
