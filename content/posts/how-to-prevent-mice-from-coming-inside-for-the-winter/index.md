As the first cold nights of fall arrive, mice that have been living comfortably outdoors begin a frantic search for warmth, shelter, and a stable food source to survive the winter. Your home provides all three.

Preventing this annual invasion is a project of **total exclusion.** Traps and baits are for dealing with a problem you already have; sealing your home is how you stop the problem from ever beginning. **The most critical factor in winter mouse prevention is a meticulous inspection and sealing of every tiny gap and crack in your home's foundation and siding.** This guide provides the same professional-grade checklist that experts use to make a home impenetrable to rodents.

### The "Why": Understanding the Fall Invasion

Mice are not looking to cause trouble; they are simply trying to survive. A house mouse that stays outdoors during a harsh winter will likely freeze or starve. Your home, particularly the dark, undisturbed voids inside your walls and attic, is the perfect winter shelter. They can squeeze through a hole the size of a dime, so any unsealed gap is an open invitation. The time to act is in late summer or early fall, *before* they feel the pressure to move inside.

### The Field-Tested Exclusion Plan

This plan is a systematic search-and-seal mission. You will need a good flashlight, a mirror for looking under things, and your sealing materials.

#### Phase 1: The Foundation and Sill Plate

This is where the vast majority of mice get in.

1.  **Inspect the Foundation:** Walk the entire perimeter of your home. Look for any cracks or gaps in the foundation. Pay special attention to the **sill plate**, which is the wooden beam that sits directly on top of the foundation. Gaps often form here.
2.  **Check All Utility Entry Points:** This is the #1 weak spot. Carefully inspect where every pipe, wire, and faucet enters your house. This includes your main electrical service, gas line, AC refrigerant lines, and hose bibs. These holes are almost always drilled larger than necessary, leaving a perfect entry point.
3.  **Seal with the Right Materials:**
    *   For small cracks (less than 1/4 inch), use a high-quality, weather-resistant caulk.
    *   For larger gaps, pack them tightly with **coarse steel wool** or **copper mesh**. Mice cannot chew through this. Then, seal over the mesh with expanding foam or caulk for a permanent fix.

#### Phase 2: Siding, Vents, and Doors

*   **Check Corner Trim:** Inspect the vertical corner trim on your siding. Gaps often form at the bottom, providing a hidden entry point.
*   **Secure Vents:** Ensure that all vents (attic, soffit, dryer) have a secure, intact screen.
*   **Fortify Doors:** The gap under your garage door and exterior doors is a major entry point. Install new weather stripping and a tight-fitting door sweep.

#### Phase 3: Reduce Outdoor Attractants

*   **Move Firewood:** Keep any firewood stacks at least 20 feet away from the house and elevated off the ground.
*   **Trim Vegetation:** Prune back any bushes or tree branches that are touching your siding. These act as a bridge for mice to bypass your ground-level defenses.
*   **Secure Food Sources:** Make sure all trash cans have tight-fitting lids. If you feed birds, consider stopping during the winter months, as spilled seed is a major food source for rodents.

### FAQ

**Q: Is it better to use steel wool or expanding foam to seal holes?**
A: Use both. Mice can easily chew right through expanding foam. The correct professional method is to first pack the hole tightly with a chew-proof material like steel wool or copper mesh, and *then* seal over it with foam or caulk to hold it in place and make it airtight.

**Q: What about ultrasonic pest repellers? Do they work?**
A: No. Numerous studies have shown that ultrasonic devices are not an effective long-term solution for repelling rodents. Mice may be startled by the sound initially, but they quickly acclimate to it and will not be deterred from seeking the warmth and food your home offers.

**Q: I've sealed everything, but what if a mouse is already inside?**
A: If you suspect a mouse has already made it in before you sealed the exterior, you need to use traps. The most effective and humane option is the classic wooden snap trap. Place them along the walls in the areas where you've seen signs of activity (like the basement, attic, or under the kitchen sink). Bait with a tiny amount of peanut butter. Trapping is the solution for the inside; sealing is the solution for the outside.
