##  What Should I Feed My Bearded Dragon?

###  1. Can Bearded Dragons Eat Meat?

But [wild-bearded dragons](https://www.nationalgeographic. com/animals/reptiles/group/bearded-dragon/) will mainly feed on animals, including mice, rats, worms, roaches ( [check roach killers](https://pestpolicy.com/best-roach-killer-for-apartments/) ), & crickets. So, yes, Bearded Dragons will eat meat mainly from different insects. But they'll also eat some fruit and vegetables. They related - [best drain cleaner](https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//).

Here are the insects that insect meat that the bearded dragons will eat. 1. Phoenix worms 2. Mealworms 3. Waxworms 4. Crickets 5. Cockroaches 6. Butterworms 7. Earthworms 8. King worms 9. Crickets 10. Locusts 11. Dubai roaches 12. Silkworms However, only adult Bearded Dragons because of their exterior skin that's hard. Therefore, don't give the baby bearded dragons such as insect meat.

###  2. Include Extra Supplements and Proteins

Besides the fruits and vegetables, I suggest you get some extra supplements (substrates) plus some proteins to spice up the bearded dragon's diet. The diet can include feeding them a dragon with 2-3 meals daily plus some additional supplements and an extra meal or insect - these provide the critical proteins. Avoid lowing insects, including Lightning bugs, since they're toxic to your dragons.

I recommend you feed your dragon with just the gut-loaded insects, which points out that they'll provide a high level of nutrients. Further, offer some Dubai [baby roaches](https://pestpolicy.com/what-do-baby-roaches-look-like//), earthworms, crickets besides spraying some calcium powder on the pet's food. You may add some meal-worms, wax-worms, and butter-worms for extra fat.

##  What Fruit Do Bearded Dragons Eat?

###  1. Strawberries?

Strawberries are a favorite food for bearded dragons, but you must wash and cut them into small pieces before giving them to your beadier. But, can bearded dragons eat strawberry seeds? Well, bearded dragons will eat the strawberry seeds since they're located outside the fruit - particularly on the achenes ovaries.

Strawberry seeds will provide the beardies with great nutrients but don't feed them excessively to your pet as it'll lead to stomach problems.

###  2. Bananas?

Bearded dragons will eat bananas (phosphorus)- however - only be 1-2 times every 30 days. Excessive feeding with bananas may lead to sicknesses like Metabolic Bone disease due to calcium deficiency. Bananas will contain the following nutrients Calcium (5 mg), Phosphorus (22 mg), Magnesium (27 mg), and Iron (0. 3 mg) that'll be helpful to your Bearded dragons if fed in moderation. 1. Dates 2. Melon 3. Figs 4. Apricots 5. Guava 6. Apples 7.

Plums 8. Pears 9. Peaches 10. Strawberries 11. Mango 12.

Papaya 13. Grapes 14. Raisins 15. Kiwi 16. Apricots However, you must be careful as you feed your bearded dragon with some of this soft fruit such as kiwi because they'll ferment due to their sugary nature - which eventually causes teeth issues.

##  What Vegetables Can Bearded Dragons Eat?

The baby of bearded dragons won't feed on most of the vegetables out there. Mainly, baby beardies eat 20% vegetables + fruits and 80% insects. Please don't feed the pet with pale vegetables such as celery or iceberg lettuce because they have limited nutrients. Adult bearded dragons eat 80% vegetables + fruits and 20% insects - a total reverse of what the baby beardies eat.

Bearded dragons eat many vegetables, including turnip greens, mustard, and collards. 1. Parsnip 2. Ocra 3. Bok choi 4.

Yellow squash 5. Acorn squash 6. Butternut squash 7. Bell pepper 8. Okra 9. Cabbage 10. Green beans 11. Sweet potato 12. Asparagus 13. Brocolli (small bits weekly) 14. Peas 15. Courgette 16. Kohlrabi 17. Celery Don't feed the Bearded dragons with spinach - simply because these leafy vegetables will significantly bind their calcium, and thus the pet won't absorb them easily.

Bearded dragons will also eat leafy vegetables like kale, bell peppers, carrots, pumpkin, squash, cabbage, and cucumbers without their peel. 1. Rocket 2. Coriander 3. Mustard greens 4. Endive 5. Collards 6. Turnip greens 7. Clover 8. Parsley 9. Dandelion greens 10. Kale
