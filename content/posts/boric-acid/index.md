Boric acid, also known as orthoboric acid, boracic acid, and hydrogen borate is a
[boron-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron)
but weak monobasic
[Lewis acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_acid)
.

Boric acid (H
3
BO
3
) is largely used in many commercial products like neutron absorbers, preserving ingredients, flame retardants,
[insecticides](https://pestpolicy.com/does-boric-acid-kill-roaches/)
, and
[antiseptics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1712169/)
.
- The white powder or colorless crystals of this Boric acid (first created by Wilhelm Homberg) will dissolve in water.

## Boric AcidOccurrence
You'll mainly find Boric acid around volcanic areas like Nevada, Lipari Islands, andTuscany as
[sassolite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sassolite)
- which is a free state. It has antimicrobial and antifungal properties.

In the areas, sassolite mixes with underground steam to form minerals such as colemanite, ulexite (boronatrocalcite), boracite, and
borax
.
## What Is Boric Acid Used For?
Boric acid (H
3
BO
3
) is a white powder or colorless crystals used as a neutron absorber, preserving ingredients, flame retardants,
[pesticides](http://npic.orst.edu/ingred/products.html)
, and antiseptic.
### 1. Roach Killer
If used correctly, boric acid is
[good for killingcockroaches](https://pestpolicy.com/does-boric-acid-kill-roaches/)
. Incorrect usage will make the
boric acid reduce its roach-killing potency.
You can mic the
boric acid (powder - 2 tablespoons
) with
1 cup of water and sugar (2 cups) to kill roaches. Sugar acts as an attractant for while boric acid poisons the bugs.
Roches will infest your office, restaurants, and homes - to most people these bugs are repulsive and unsightly but will also cause major health risks (in indoor spaces) to pets and people.
Roaches will carry germs on their leg spines while crawling on various decaying materials - they may contaminate human food with these causing salmonella and E. coli.
Further, roaches' skin sheddings, saliva, and droppings have allergens that may cause asthma and allergic reactions, particularly in kids.
But roaches will die when they crawl over areas treated (sprayed) with boric acid due to poisoning. They'll absorb the poison through the exoskeleton, antennae, and legs.
Luckily, boric acid will also kill other bugs that disturb humans including wood borers, beetles,
silverfish
,
termites
, fleas, and also ants.
### 2. Household Cleaner
Boric acid is an excellent product for cleaning around the house. It's an
excellent mold-killer
, deodorizer, disinfectant, stain-remover,
and cleanser.
It can help remove
odor and stains from your fabrics - by adding 1/2 cup of boric acid into the laundry. It'll also work great for cleaning windows, bathroom, floor, and sinks.
You'll find
Borax used in cleaning products like diaper creams, glasscleaners, dish detergents, air fresheners, stain removers (laundry), and toilet bowlcleaners plus
ant killers
.
But is it safe for home cleaning? Yes, boric acid is safe,
effective, and powerful to use as a household cleaner and pesticide. It has a limited risk to humans or pets - for large doses.
For cleaning toilet bowls or
[clogged drainages](https://pestpolicy.com/best-drain-cleaner//)
, you'll need to simply pour the boric acid on the surfaces and let it work for roughly 1/2 an hour.
### **3. Treats Yeast Infections**
Boric acid is also an effective solution for treating yeast infections, especially yeast infections. Medics recommend it (as female suppositories) for the prevention of Candida fungi.
The
capsule (female BA capsules) is inserted into the female and it'll be effective for 6 - 12 months - apply for 7 days t 2 weeks depending on the infection intensity.
Boric acid suppositories for the female are reported by CDC to be more effective than oral azole in treating the systems of candida -

.
### 4. Acne Treatment - Boracic Water
Boric acid can be used as an antiseptic that'll effectively disinfection your chapped or irritated skin, and minor burns - but it's also a great acne treatment as its antibacterial.
But this substance has some low toxicity on the human skin - and it might be corrosive to your eyes. So you might get effects such as diarrhea, stomach aches, vomiting, and nausea.
Boric acid will ease or heal breakouts related to bacteria (
*Propionibacterium acnes*
) thanks to its antibacterial properties. But it's outlawed in many places as it may also irritate the skin.

But is boric acid safe for pimples? Well, yes boric acid has antibacterial properties that'll treat acne but also prevent athlete's foot - if the powder is inserted in your stockings or socks.
Will the boric acid be safe for the face? Boric acid and borax will irritate the skin mildly but it's very corrosive to the eyes or when eaten.
### 5. Prevent Athletes Foot
Further, you may use boric acid for the
prevention
of
recurrent
athlete's foot - just put some of the powder into the stockings or socks.
Further, boric acid will prevent toenail fungus and stinky feet- just sprinkle some of this powder on the stockings and socks - just like you do with theathletes foot.
It's also excellent for foot fungus or
tinea-pedis infections
treatment - you can also use
undecylenicacid or boric acid as they'll hinder dermatophyte growth.
Finally, boric acid offers a fast way to cure that toenail fungus. Simply sprinkle the boric acid or baking soda onto the shoes and socks - they reduce moisture on the nails.
## Symptoms and Signs of Boric acid Exposure
Some of the prevalent signs of boric acid exposure include bright red skin rash, diarrhea, and blue-green vomit. Inhaling borax will cause dry throat, nose, and mouth.
As noted above, boric acid will be toxic to your skin, and it's also corrosive to the human skin. You may experience nose bleeding, shortness of breath, sore throat, and coughing.
For infants, they may experience a coma, confusion, convulsions, and abnormal postures in addition to nervous system effects. Thus, ensure a treatment in 2 hours.
Boric acid will be safe for pets and humans if moderately exposed - but excessive exposure lad to chronic and acute effects. For example, ingesting
[roach-killing items](https://pestpolicy.com/best-roach-killer-for-apartments/)
causes acute poisoning.

Will boric acid affect wildlife including fish and birds?No, boric acid is largely non-toxic to most
[wildlife](http://npic.orst.edu/envir/wildlife.html)
including fish and birds - but it may prove slightly toxic to bees and some fresh-water fish.
