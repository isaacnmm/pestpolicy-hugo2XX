If used around the house (beyond just the Yard), [Vet's Best Flea Spray](https://pestpolicy.com/best-flea-spray-for-yard/) will leave no stains even in places that the pets eat, play, sleep or live. - However, you'll need to test a small area like on pant legs or shoes before you undertake full-blown spraying. Now, point the spray nozzle in any direction in your Yard or lawn to spray.

However, ensure that you flea-spray the yard area evenly and avoid forming a puddle.

##  Considerations in Yard Flea Spray

###  1. Ease-of-use and Duration:

The flea sprays for yards we've reviewed can be used with a garden sprayer. Some even come with a very handy hose applicator. Most of the products we've reviewed last 3-4 weeks. *How long does the spray last? * - The longer the duration, the less frequently you'll need to spray your Yard. Most flea yard sprays last 3-4 weeks, despite what the product labels may claim. Cheaper sprays will wash away in the rain. *Where can it be used?

* - Check whether the spray can be used on lawns, flowers, shrubs, and sidewalks. While it's hard to find sprays that can be safely used on vegetable patches, you want to make sure that most of your Yard is covered. Some sprays can even be used indoors, giving you great value for money.

###  2. Coverage and Whether it only kills adult [fleas](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-treat-fleas-in-the-yard/):

Is it suitable for small or large yards? Some yard sprays are very effective in killing adult fleas quickly on contact. However, these probably won't kill the eggs and larvae. This means you'll need to spray again after the insects have hatched and grown. *How much area does the spray cover? * -If you have a small yard, then a lower capacity will do.

But for larger yards, you either want to buy a higher capacity spray or end up getting multiple bottles. So it's essential to check the coverage.

*Is the yard spray valid for the entire [flea](https://pestpolicy.com/at-what-temperature-do-fleas-die/) life cycle? * This is probably the most important thing for you to consider when choosing a flea spray for your Yard. If you're looking for a cheap, quick solution, then get a yard spray that only kills adult fleas.
