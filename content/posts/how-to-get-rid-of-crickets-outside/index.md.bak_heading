##  The Answer: Effective Ways to Get Rid of Crickets Outside

**The simplest way to get rid of crickets outside is to: ** 1. **Maintain Proper Lawn Care: **A well
- maintained lawn is your first line of defense against crickets. They thrive in tall grass and weeds, so keeping your lawn well
- groomed discourages them from setting up camp.
- **Regular Mowing**: Frequent mowingof your lawn keeps the grass short and less attractive to crickets.

Aim to mow your lawn at least once a week during the cricket season, which typically peaks in late summer.

Additionally, consider adjusting your lawnmower's blade height to ensure you're not leaving the grass too long.
- **Removing Debris**: Clear away leaf litter, dead plants, and any other debris from your yard. Crickets are drawn to hiding spots, and these items provide them with ideal shelter. Regularly cleaning your yard also helps reduce other potential pests that crickets feed on.
- **Proper Watering**: Crickets are attracted to moist environments, so avoid overwatering your lawn.

Water your lawn early in the day to allow it to dry before evening, reducing the cricket
- friendly moisture levels. 2. **Reduce Exterior Lighting: **Crickets are attracted to light, so consider using less outdoor lighting at night or switching to yellow or sodium vapor bulbs, which are less attractive to them.
- **Use Yellow or Sodium Vapor Bulbs**: Replace white or bright outdoor bulbs with yellow or sodium vapor bulbs.

These emit light that is less appealing to crickets and other insects.

The wavelength of light produced by these bulbs is less attractive to crickets, making them a practical choice for outdoor lighting.
- **Limit Outdoor Lighting**: Consider reducing the amount of outdoor lighting you use at night. Only use lighting when necessary, and turn it off when you're done to minimize cricket activity. Motion
- activated lights are a great option, as they only illuminate when needed.
- **Position Lights Wisely**: If you must use outdoor lighting, position the lights away from doors and windows to draw crickets away from your home. Placing lights closer to the perimeter of your property can help keep crickets at bay. 3. **Seal Entry Points: **Cricket prevention starts with sealing any potential entry points into your home.
- **Caulk and Seal Cracks**: Inspect the exterior of your home for cracks, gaps, or holes.

Use caulk or sealant to fill these openings, preventing crickets from finding their way inside. Pay close attention to areas around windows, doors, utility openings, and where utility lines enter your home.
- **Install Weather Stripping**: Ensure that doors and windows are properly sealed with weather stripping. This not only keeps crickets out but also helps with energy efficiency.

Replace any worn or damaged weather stripping promptly to maintain a secure barrier.

In addition to the core strategies mentioned above, you can explore natural remedies to deter crickets: 1. **Diatomaceous Earth**: This natural, powdery substance made from fossilized aquatic organisms can be sprinkled around cricket
- prone areas to create a barrier that damages their exoskeletons, ultimately leading to their demise.
- **How to Use Diatomaceous Earth**: To applydiatomaceous earth, simply sprinkle it in areas where you suspect cricket activity.

Focus on spots near potential entry points, hiding spots, and areas where crickets congregate. 2. **Neem Oil**: Derived from the neem tree, neem oil has insect
- repelling properties. Mixing neem oil with water and spraying it on outdoor surfaces can help deter crickets and other pests.
- **Creating a Neem Oil Spray**: Mix one part neem oil with ten parts water and add a few drops of liquid dish soap.

Pour this mixture into a spray bottle and apply it to outdoor areas where crickets are a problem.

3. **Cedarwood**: Cedarwood emits a scent that repels crickets and many other insects. Consider placing cedarwood chips or cedar oil
- soaked cotton balls in strategic outdoor locations, such as near entry points or in your garden.
