##  Considerations for the Best Self-Propelled Lawnmowers under 300

###  1. Forward or rear-wheel drive system

Rear-wheel mounted mowers offer more manoeuvrability as compared to forward wheel drive system because the lawnmower is propelled from behind where the machines weight is concentrated. On the other hand, the front-wheel-drive system is not ideal for manoeuvrability but it barely poses any challenges when mowing the lawn.

###  2. Size of the lawn

If you own a large lawn, self-propelled mowers are not ideal. Accordingly, self-propelled lawn mowers are considered to be more ideal for small and medium-sized lawns. The terrain - Depending on how rocky or hilly the lawn terrain is, you might want to go for a gas-powered lawn mower because it has more torque than electric-powered models.

In addition, a self-propelled mower with different speed settings is considered more ideal for tough terrains.

###  3. Size of the wheel

This is an important consideration in the sense that larger wheels allow you to manoeuvre corners more easily as compared to smaller wheels. At the same time, a large wheel size offers enough ground clearance to allow you to mow through tough terrains. In addition, users should go heavy-duty wheels rather than plastic wheels to avoid damage.

###  4. Adjustable handlebars

No matter the height of the user, most self-propelled mowers feature adjustable handlebars which ease storage and portability. Blade override system - This feature saves the user the stress of having to restart the equipment all the time. One can get stones and other obstacles out of the way by taking their hand off the lever.

###  5. Reliability

As compared to push mowers, self-propelled mowers are more likely to break down because they contain many moving parts. Different models have different reliability issues. Whereas Honda is deemed as the most reliable brand whereas Snapper mowers have a poor reputation for breaking down. Power - The power of the self-propelled mower is an important consideration depending on how hilly the terrain is or the thickness of the grass.

A 160cc engine capacity is considered ideal for such conditions.

At the same time, powerful engines tend to be less economical if you are dealing with a small budget.

##  Conclusion

After searching through the available self-propelled models, my ideal choice is the Troy-Bilt TB37O 163cc 21 RWD self-propelled mower. This units 8 by 8 wheels are heavy duty and designed for tackling the toughest terrains. A four-speed setting offers optimal performance in the toughest conditions.
