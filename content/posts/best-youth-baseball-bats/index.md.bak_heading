##  Best Youth Baseball Bats
- Buyer's Guide

And another thing: Youth bats are controlled by the USSSA 1. 15 Bat Performance Factor (BPF) standards, which determines how fast the baseball bounces of the bat.
- Youth baseball bats have a light and straightforward design but are adequately rough to allow rough handling. They are created from composite, alloy, or high
- tech materials.

##  Conclusion

What does this imply? The new baseball standard aims to level the playing for pitchers and batters since previous bats had become too powerful and thus unfairly advantaged batters using the hot bats.
- Further, the new bats should match the 2 5/8
- and 2 1/4
- inch dimensions. Also, a drop
- weight limit will not be applied. However, the solid wood and one
- piece bats are auto
- approved for the new standard.
