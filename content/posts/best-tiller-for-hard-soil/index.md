##  **How to Choose the Best Tiller for Hard Soil**

The choice of a garden tiller will generally determine how effectively and easily you do the work. Your typical tiller should penetrate deep and effectively turn the soil to promote good drainage and aeration.

###  **1. Size of the Tiller**

Usually garden tillers come in different sizes and robustness depending on the size of projects theyre meant for. That means the size of tiller will be determined by the size of your garden or the area you want to till. If you have a small garden, you require a mini tiller which is lightweight and less robust. Such a tiller will cost you less and consume less fuel.

However, you require a bigger equipment for a larger garden (greater than 4800 square feet).

###  **2. Soil Condition**

You want a tiller for hard soil. However, the soil might also be characterised by other factors such as rocks or compactness. So, its paramount to assess the exact condition of the soil to help you choose the most effective tiller. New ground might present a big challenge for many tillers since the soil tends to be compact and sometimes full of tangling roots.

In this case, only a robust tiller will penetrate, slice the roots and turn the soil effectively.

Small tillers tend to get tangled with roots.

###  **3. Engine**

Usually, therere electrical, battery and gas-powered garden tillers. The choice of engine will entirely depend on personal preferences and where you are going to use the tiller. For gardens far from the source of electricity, it would be impractical to opt for a corded electrical tiller. Since battery-powered tillers are not in common use, a gas-powered tiller is the best option for such a garden.

If youre strictly environmentally conscious, you may want to go for the electrical tiller.

Notably, gas-powered tillers tend to be more robust and durable and are good for tackling hard soil.

###  **4. Tines/Blades**

Tines come in different shapes and designs. The three most common type of tine include the bolo tines, chisel tines and the slasher tines. Bolo tines are preferred for their ability to dig deep into the soil. These come in handy when you want to plant your crops in the right depth. Check Front Tine vs. Rear Tine Tillers. Chisel tines are ideal for tackling hard and rocky soils especially when breaking new ground.

Slasher tines help in cutting through tangling roots and weeds.

Also the manner in which the tines rotate determines the effectiveness of the tilling. Normally, tines can either rotate forward or counter-rotate. The best choice for hard soil and breaking new ground are those with counter-rotating motion.

###  **5. Wheels**

Not all tillers are designed with wheels. Tillers that come with wheels are easier to manoeuvre making the work less tiresome. They also help in maintaining stability on loose and rugged soil. Therefore, if wheels are part of your consideration, go for those with the best characteristics. Agricultural-grade wheels are robust, give stability and are very durable.

###  **6. Maintenance**

You want an equipment that will be easy to maintain. Usually, its much easier to maintain electric tillers compared to gas tillers. For, battery powered electric tillers youll have to deal with battery replacement from time to time. Although gas-powered tillers dont use batteries or cords, they require regular maintenance. But it wont be an issue if you have some basic mechanical know how.

##  **Conclusion**

While therere many tillers for hard soil to choose from, getting the most effective for your garden can be challenging. But looking at these reviews and buying guide it is possible to know what to expect in your equipment. So, take your time and choose the best tiller to make your garden chores more effective and less tiresome.
