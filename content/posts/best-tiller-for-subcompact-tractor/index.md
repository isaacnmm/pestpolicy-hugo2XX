# # **Considerations for Buying Best Tiller for Subcompact Tractor**

**1. Forward or Reverse** This consideration should be to of your questions to ask when you seek a tiller. Usually, a reverse- rotating tiller will dig deeper into the ground, while forward-rotating tiller will bounce off hardpans - [rear tine tillers](https: //pestpolicy. com/best-rear-tine-tiller/). So, consider the nature of the land you want to till. If it is slightly soft, then a forward-rotating tiller will work for you.

However, if it is hard, then you are better off with a reverse-rotating tiller. Forward-rotating tillers are also excellent on rocky places, as they will fling the rocks away from the rotor. **2. Number of Tines** The number of tines varies the HP of the rotor. Also, more tines per flange mean that you will have a rotor with a heavier weight, which will add to your maintenance cost.

So, before you buy a tiller, ensure that your subcompact tractor can manage the weight and horsepower of the tiller. High HP would mean high engine power. Thus, you will use more fuel. Also, more tines will result in more weight, meaning that you get that advantage. Knowing which tiller is perfect for your subcompact tractor will be critical in how the rest of the farming exercise goes on.

Thus, you must find out what and why you need the tiller before putting money into it. **3.

Gear or Chain** These two drive options will often come with their merits and demerits and will also depend on factors including your land type and the soil conditions. Gear-driven tillers will often pull harder on the earth, making them perfect for hard soils. They provide more torque, which means that you can use them to open up new land for farming. However, their spare parts will be hard to come by when they do break up.

A chain-driven tiller has less struggle when they break down, as you will easily find chains in a farm machinery hardware store. Gear-driven tillers also weigh more, which will mean that you incur additional costs when shipping. **4. Weight** Having a tiller with the right weight is also essential. Weight will often come with a high shipping cost, but if it what you need, then you should do it.

Let's say you have a farm that has hard earth or parched clay soil, then having a tiller that weighs down on the ground will work better. Anything light will not penetrate deep enough. You might end up damaging the plates or tines, as they will only be hitting against the ground, not digging into it. Weight is also critical in what you intend to use the tiller.

Some tillers might come with adjustable gears that would help you take the pressure off the tiller to allow you carry out various functions, including preparing for farming, clearing bushes, loosening up the soil for better aeration, mixing up the fertilizers in the ground among many other features. You will need to consider the above when you choose the weight off on your tiller and the primary function of the tiller.

# # **Conclusion**

With several new models of tillers coming out this year, finding the right one for your subcompact tractor is essential in helping you farm better, without incurring too much cost. But as we see, the tillers all have varying strengths and work better in some areas. On how to maximize each will depend on your most pressing needs.
