So, to differentiate fleas from other things, you may need to position the speck you found on some paper and use your magnifying glass to check if the object has that oval shape that characterizes flea eggs.

Dogs may pick fleas from different locations including carpets and even from other pets. So, when the dog is effectively attacked by fleas it'll drop flea eggs and adult fleas as it moves on its trail.
