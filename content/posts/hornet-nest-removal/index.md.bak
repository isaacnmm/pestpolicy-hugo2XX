This is a [Hornet](https://pestpolicy.com/hornet-bees-and-wasp-removal-tacoma/)[Nest](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-find-a-roach-nest/) Removal guide. It is a kind of unpleasant situation for you if you are having a hornet or wasps nest around in or near your place. - It can get nastier, especially if there are kids or anyone with an allergic issue to their stings (insect venom).

I will discuss the ultimate[guide for the Hornet Nest](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-find-a-roach-nest/)Removal.

- Any movement or activity near the nest might lead the hornets to launch an aggressive mob and chase down and eventually stifle the offender. This launch of aggression can be for both humans and pets. The existence of this hornet nest is indeed a nuisance and deserves to be dealt with full throttle. If you are careful and concern for your family, you can rid of them yourself and that too very easily.

##  #1: Take Safety Measures

There are countless ways of [keeping the hornets away](https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef620).It is not easy to get rid of them. - If you are careful, you can eliminate their existence without even the services of a professional exterminator. - Hornets can sting hard and can do it several times and will do so aggressively.

One thing should be kept in mind before attempting to remove it; this can be a risky project to undertake irrespective of whether you are allergic to it or not; caution should be taken care of.

##  #2: Bag the Hornets

This technique of removing hornet nest works nicely if two people do it at a time and at the same time if the nest is developing downwards like a tree branch. The ideal time to perform this act is during sunshine when supposedly hornets are inert.

##  #3: Outfit

Before launching a kind of assault on hornets, a correct and safe outfit should be worn. - The simple definition of this outfit is that it should be covering you from head to your toe. This is vital as it protects you from stings. The fabric of the outfit should be thick, to go with this, goggles and gloves are also highly advisable.

##  #4: Carry a Strong and Big Bag of Plastic

Since this method is about bagging the hornets and their nest, the primary element here is the bag. The bag's quality should be good enough to tolerate some stings of hornets on their way into the bag. It must be strong enough to oppose light rips.

##  #5: Placement of the Bag

*Test your judgmental call. * In this phase, you need to make a good judgmental call. It would help if you located the bag below the tree branch by estimating the trajectory of the fall of your nest.

##  #6: Hedge Trimmers

This is the most delicate phase of the method. In this part, you need to use long-handles hedge trimmers to cut the branch down. Once you cut the branch down, then you need to hope that it falls exactly where you have placed the plastic bag.

##  #7: FILL Your BAG & DISPOSE

If you have been successful until now, then this past is the last part of the method. Once the nest falls in the bag, you need to tie it hard. The ending part is your choice, whether you want to dispose of it or burn it away. Anyway, it will do the job just fine.

##  Where Are Hornet Nests Located?

** *The most important thing to know to dispose of these nests is to find about their location and existence. * A hornet nest generally looks like a paper or mud-like construction, mostly in the shape of a pine cone, mass lump, or like an upside-down apiary. Hornets usually search for a sheltered location to make their nest - G [etting rid of wasps' nests](https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/getting_rid_of_wasps_nests).

Found in branches of a tree, under joists, on the slide of windows, in attics, inside the usable portion of abandoned buildings or vehicles, etc. To cut the story short, any place shielded from weather and in peace can attract these hornets to build their nest. Typically, hornets prefer to build a nest in relatively high areas.

These normally include, but are not at all limited to: - Hollow tree trunks - Decking - Sheds - Treetops - Attics - Top roof corners - Garages Some nests are free-hanging and normally have a stalk called petiole. Petiole attaches the nest to an object such as a tree branch. On the other hand, some nests are built in an enclosed space that provides solid support for the nest, making it very stable.

##  Hornet Nest Vs Wasp Nest

*Do you think Hornet and Wasp Nest are the same? Think again. * The name of two species, i. e. , hornet and wasp can be at times very puzzling. Wasp and hornets have numerous things in common and, at the same time, a lot of dissimilarities as well. Scientist normally classifies the insects into different species, and in actuality, the sole real species of true hornet is the Brown Hornet or European Hornet.

If we look at a wasp and its related categories, there is a collection of wasps commonly referred to as the lone wasp in a laymans tone. This wasp group is small in number, kind of an introvert, and prefers to make their nest underground.

###  Key Difference Between Hornets And Wasps

The length of hornets is normally considered to be around 1. 5. This small in size animal can form a mostly aerial nest in the shape of a sheltered box, can be big in size, and apparently looks exactly like paper. Hornets prefer other small infections to fill up their little belly. The chances of them stinging to you increase drastically once they feel endangered. On the other side, the wasps length is less than 1, which is smaller than hornets.

They do differently from hornets because their nest is restricted to being aerial; they can also form nests on the ground level. They are a lot less aggressive than hornets. Consequently, the frequency and sharpness of the sting are less than hornets.

##  Hornets Nest in Ground

If considering size, ground hornets are extremely imposing, measuring the length of about 0. 5 inches, and at times even more than that. Hornets are also called Yellow Jackets. Ground hornets can build a nest in trees that are rotted. The next favorite destination for ground hornets to make nest are spaces in walls or ceilings. These nests are normally inaccessible and very difficult to remove.

There is a school of thought which believes that these hornets should be left alone until and unless they become capable enough to threaten you. On the other hand, the other school of thought is totally anti of this approach; they believe these ground hornets should be dealt with severely in any case.
