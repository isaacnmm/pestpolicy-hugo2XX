##  Considerations for Best Electric Tiller for Clay Soil

An overview of the electric tillers currently available in the market suggests that most brands have similar features. - Making the best choice particularly where you have to contend with clay soil is of utmost importance.

###  1. Soil type

The type of soil in your garden will determine the ease or difficulty of tilling. Whereas loose and soft soil requires relatively less power to till, a more powerful electric is needed clay soil and other hardened grounds. Compact and rocky soils need a strong tiller because it is difficult to dig up given that it sticks like glue when wet. It is also worth considering such debris as rocks and roots as you make the purchase decision.

###  2. Adjustable handle

For optimized gardening performance, you might want to consider going for a tiller with a handle that is sensitive to every slight movement. The best electric tiller for clay soil should be highly maneuverable through the right left and center.

###  3. Garden size

The larger the garden size the more versatile it should be your electric tiller. Broader gardens require a wider working width. Yet even the smallest gardens with hardened ground require a powerful tool with a deeper tilling depth. If you are dealing with large and open spaces, a corded tiller may not be convenient for you. Ensure the model you are seeking fits the needs of the space you intend to till.

###  4. The number of tines

Most electric tillers feature 2 to 4 tines. The more tines an electric tiller has the easier it will break into the background. Check the [Front Tine vs. Rear Tine Tillers](https://pestpolicy.com/front-tine-vs-rear-tine-tillers/).

###  5. Extension cord lock

Most users overlook this feature when shopping despite its importance when working in large open spaces. - Electric tillers allow the user to walk up to 100 feet away from the power source. A cord that gets unplugged more often is frustrating since you have to work back and forth to plug it. The cord lock feature alleviates this challenge.

###  6. Cost

The cost of your electric tiller of choice is determined by several factors such as power output, tiller size, durability, quality, and manufacturer brand.

###  7. Other factors

Other factors worth considering include ease of use, maintenance costs, and safety features. - The availability of forwarding and reverse features determine how freely you will move about when working on your garden. - The tine rotation available is another important component worth considering. Counter-rotating tines are considered ideal for breaking through tough ground surfaces because the wheels move in opposite directions.

##  Conclusion

If you are looking for an electric tiller for clay soil, the above list contains affordably priced, versatile and comfortable to use tools. Electric tillers are lighter and compact as compared to gas-powered models. The Scotts TC70135S 13. 5 tiller stands out from others in its class given its relatively stronger engine and durable tilling tines.
