##  How Smart are Bearded Dragons? Research

While humans may have once been the only species capable of imitation, new research has shown that some lizards are on equal footing with us in the intelligence department. - The[University of Lincoln, U. K research](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/news/2014/09/970.asp)aimedto provide a better understanding of the intelligence of bearded dragons - through imitation testing. The bearded dragons were studied while in terrariums.

They were offered a wire door and get to the sumptuous mealworm. 1.

**Group 1**- One bearded [dragon](https://pestpolicy.com/can-bearded-dragons-eat-apples/)was shown a video where another bearded dragon was opening the wire door from the left 2. **Group 2**- Another bearded dragon was shown a video where another bearded dragon was opening the wire door from the right 3. **Group 3**- Another bearded dragon was shown a video where a human being was opening the wire door 4.

**Control group**- Four bearded dragons didn't get any video instruction on how to open the wire door **The results and conclusion? ** 1. **Group 1 and Group 2**(shown videos of other bearded dragons opening the wire door) acted in exactly the same way and even followed the direction used in opening the door in the video. 2.

**Group 3**- But bearded dragon showed a video of human beings opening the wire door didn't open the door; i. e. no imitation observed. 3.

Finally, in the control group (the bearded dragons were not shown any videos) and the finding was that they did not learn door opening. **Conclusion? ** 1. Bearded dragons are clever animals and they can learn from one another especially through imitation. 2. Bearded dragons use their intellectual ability to imitate other bearded dragons better than they can mimic humans. 3.

It took about three weeks for bearded dragons to understand and imitate the video instruction.

This was achieved by placing Trained Breaded Dragon with untrained ones. When untrained Bearded Dragons saw trained ones open the door to access food, they were also able to open too.

Recognize their owner or people who feed them. 4. Locate a place to poop/excrete. 5.

Wave to people/visitors. 6. Escape danger. To achieve these skills in the Bearded Dragon, you must train one skill for a given period of time. It is not possible for the Bearded Dragon to master all these skills simultaneously.

Allow the Bearded Dragon to move about in an enclosed cage for some hours. This can be done effectively by setting up little food in bowls at various points to attract its movement. Keep watch from a distance to see if it has any signs of stress (showing an aggressive posture). 5. Once you realize that your Bearded Dragon is now free with you, pick it with your hand and softly rub its back softly to kill its tension or fear.

Do not lift the Bearded Dragon from behind this may make it get angered or generate fear. Never raise it up by the tail it may startle. The tail of the Bearded Dragon does not grow back once cut.

But, when Bearded Dragon gets aggressive, it begins to Hiss, open its mouth, stare, bobbing its head, puffing the beards or generate stress marks.

The reaction may be caused by stress, stiff competition in the case, being scared often, shedding, hormonal imbalances, breeding season, or environmental change.
