##  **Should You Disassemble Your Trampoline During Winter? **

Most trampoline owners ponder this question a lot. To answer it directly, I would say it depends. But, if you have enough storage space, you can always take them down and store to reassemble later. It depends on the level of snow you usually experience in your area, the manufacturers opinion about the ability of the structure to survive in winter, and your personal preference.

However, it is important to note that most trampolines are made of durable, rust-resistant materials, and therefore, there is no need of dissembling them during winter. If you have decided to disassemble, you dont have to remove the entire structure. Only detach the springs, the soft frame, the safety netting, and the jumping mat.

Leave all the poles that secure the safety netting as well as the frame metal that connects the mat and the springs standing outside.
