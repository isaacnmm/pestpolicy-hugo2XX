## Signs of a Rodent Infestation
Detecting a rodent infestation early is key to preventing extensive damage and health risks. Look for the following signs:
- **Droppings**: Rodent droppings are a clear indicator of an infestation. Look for them in cupboards, along baseboards, and near food sources.
- **Gnaw Marks**: Rodents gnaw on wood, wires, and food packaging. Fresh gnaw marks are lighter in color and become darker as they age.
- **Nests**: Rodents build nests from shredded paper, fabric, and other soft materials. Nests are often found in hidden, undisturbed areas.
- **Noises**: Scratching or scurrying sounds, especially at night, indicate rodent activity within walls, ceilings, or attics.
- **Footprints**: In dusty areas, look for rodent tracks or tail marks.
## Prevention Tips for Puyallup Homeowners
Preventing rodents from entering your home is the most effective way to avoid an infestation. Here are some tips specific to Puyallup:
1. **Seal Entry Points**: Inspect your home for potential entry points, such as gaps around doors, windows, and utility lines. Use steel wool,caulk, or metal sheeting to seal these openings, as rodents can gnaw through less durable materials.
2. **Eliminate Food Sources**: Keep food in airtight containers and clean up crumbs and spills promptly. Do not leave pet food out overnight.
3. **Reduce Clutter**: Rodents thrive in cluttered areas. Keep storage areas organized and dispose of unnecessary items.
4. **Maintain Landscaping**: Trim trees and shrubs away from your home to prevent rodents from using them as pathways. Keep your yard tidy and free of debris, such as piles of leaves or wood.
5. **Secure Garbage**: Use rodent-proof garbage cans with tight-fitting lids and store them away from the home.
## Natural Rodent Control Methods
For those who prefer environmentally friendly solutions, several natural methods can help control rodents:
- **Peppermint Oil**: Rodents dislike the strong smell of peppermint oil. Soak cotton balls in peppermint oil and place them in areas where rodents are active.
- [**Ultrasonic Repellents**](https://pestpolicy.com/best-ultrasonic-pest-repellers/): These devices emit high-frequency sounds that are unpleasant to rodents but inaudible to humans and pets.
- **Cats**: Having a cat can naturally deter rodents from entering your home.
## Chemical and Mechanical Control Methods
When natural methods are insufficient, consider the following control options:
- **Traps**: Snap traps, electronic traps, and live traps can be effective for capturing and removing rodents. Place traps along walls and in areas where rodent activity is noticed.
- **Rodenticides**: Poison baits can be used but should be handled with care, especially in homes with children and pets. Follow all safety instructions and consider professional assistance.

Rats can be particularly challenging due to their size and behavior. Here are some additional tips for dealing with rats in Puyallup:
- **Professional Inspection**: If you suspect a rat infestation, a professional inspection can identify entry points and nesting sites.
