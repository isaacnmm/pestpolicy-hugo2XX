I am sitting here in my rented property - and I am at a loss of what to do that'll clear this bed bug infestation. I moved into the house eight months ago! But, my son and I have had a nightmare with bed bugs bites - these red irritated and itchy bumps. *There are many exaggerated claims out there on lavender and other essential oils for household & medicinal uses. But, does lavender Kill Bed Bugs (check pictures)?

* *The simple answer is, No, Lavender won't kill bed bugs - but the bugs don't like its smell. So, mixing lavender oil with rubbing alcohol (91% proof) will repel or deter the bloodsuckers. * *Lavender won't be an excellent long term treatment but will keep the bites to a minimum! ! ! Side Note: Also, bed bugs hate cedar oil, bleach, vinegar, and tea tree. *

##  Does Lavender Kill Bed Bugs? DIY Bed Bug Removal

No major scientific research points to the effectiveness of lavender in killing bed bugs. This [entomology case study](https://academic.oup.com/jee/article-abstract/111/1/170/4662900?redirectedFrom=fulltext)points out that essential oils, including lavender, aren't as effective as bed bug sprays. This doesn't mean that all essential oils won't kill bed bugs.

A [recent Rutgers University study](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/5/4/849)reported an insecticide made from cedar and geranium oil kill bed bug in a quarter of the treated houses. What about real lavender? Real lavender will repel bed bugs but won't be as effective as a lavender spray. Lavender is proven to poison pets and animals, causing vomiting and nausea.

However, bed bugs will wittingly move around the real lavender, and thus they won't get to ingest it - remember, bed bugs are only about 1/4 inch in body size.

##  How DoesLavender Repel Bed Bugs?

However, for lavender, [bed bugs](https://pestpolicy.com/what-animals-eat-[bed-bugs](https://pestpolicy.com/does-baby-powder-kill-bed-bugs/)/)will mainly react to its harsh smell instead of being toxic to their bodies. Naturally, bed bugs will escape from any unique smell - as a defense mechanism. For example, these bloodsuckers will escape when they small a new body scent, pesticides, or desiccant dust.

Thus, lavender would only be useful if you spray all the house areas - this is impossible.

But is it just the smell? Well, no, Lavender can be toxic to the bed bug's skin and body. However, bed bugs would need to ingest the Lavender oil for the poison to work. Bed bugs will escape before they get to ingest Lavender - they'll hide and re-emerge as a more massive colony. Lavender will poison your kids, pets, and even adult humans.

Also, applying Lavender on your skin may cause hives, rashes, or other severe skin reactions for both humans and your lovely pets - so avoid any direct skin contact.

##  WillLavender Scented Candles Kill Bed Bugs?

The lavender-scented candles will generate the scent that's hatred by bed bugs. But, can this lavender smell from candles kill bed bugs? Will it get into crevices and cracks. Sadly, just like the regular lavender, the smell from candles won't kill these bloodsuckers. Also, the scent won't distribute into the whole house to entirely repel the bugs. The Smell from the candles is low concentrated compared to essential oils.

Hence, it won't repel bed bugs entirely or cause allergy on humans - even when inhaled. Sadly, the small lavender reaches into the crevices and cracks, or the mattress folds and electrical outlets - which are the deep areas bed bugs hide.

##  Does Lavender Powder Kill Bed Bugs?

Next, we consider lavender powder -, this is a powder of the real lavender powered that's dried and then pounded. It is also available commercially in different stores. However, like the candles, the lavender powder will repel the bloodsuckers but will not kill [bed bugs like diatomaceous earth](https://pestpolicy.com/does-diatomaceous-earth-kill-bed-bugs/)- DE will suck the insect's body fluids.

Therefore, despite being highly concentrated, the lavender powder won't kill bed bugs because they won't get to ingest it. However, the lavender powder would work for longer in repelling bed bugs since it'll stick on different surfaces.

##  Does Lavender Dryer Sheets Kill Bed Bugs?

Lavender dryer sheets wont work to kill bed bugs! Sadly so, but thats the fact, just like it is with lavender sprays or powders. However, lavender dryer sheets will only repel the bed bugs. In short, the dryer sheets are only sheets passed through a dryer and have a pleasant scent of your fabrics or clothes. But, this wont kill the [bloodsucking bed bugs](https://pestpolicy.com/can-bed-bugs-get-in-your-hair/).

Interestingly, these Lavender producers might not also be using the real Lavender explains why the products will only repel the bed bugs and not kill them. Practically, youll not cover all the surfaces of your house.
