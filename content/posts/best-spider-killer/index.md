###  Understanding Spider Infestations

Spiders are often found in yards and homes due to two main reasons: 1. **Floating Baby Spiders: **After hatching, baby spiders can travel long distances by floating on air currents, potentially ending up in your home or yard. This makes complete eradication challenging. 2. **"Your House Is Theirs" Principle: **Spiders often establish their territory within your home, creating webs and laying eggs.

This behavior makes them difficult to eliminate entirely.

###  Best Outdoor and Indoor Pesticides

**Outdoor Pesticides: ** - Look for products with long-term residual effects and strong sticking power. Cyfluthrin and Permethrin-based pesticides are effective for outdoor use and remain active for up to 90 days. **Indoor Pesticides: ** - Choose low-odor, water-based products to avoid respiratory issues.
