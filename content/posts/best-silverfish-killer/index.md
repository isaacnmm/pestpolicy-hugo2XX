When choosing the **best silverfish [killer](https: //pestpolicy. com/best-mosquito-killer/)**, you can consider things like effectiveness, safety for pets and children, ease of use, and the speed at which it delivers results. Silverfish infestations can be tricky, but with the right product, you can quickly eliminate these pests and prevent them from returning.

##  Key Factors to Consider

###  1.**Effectiveness**

Some products, like [**Dekko Silverfish Paks**](https: //www. amazon. com/dp/B002Y2OW6A/? tag=p-policy-20), are specifically designed for targeting silverfish infestations. The active ingredients in these products kill silverfish by luring them in with a bait, ensuring you eliminate the pests without much effort.

Effectiveness also depends on how long the product continues to work after application, ensuring long-term protection.

###  2.**Safety**

If you have pets or small children, you'll want to choose a product that is safe to use around them.
