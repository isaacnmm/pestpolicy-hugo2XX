Hey guys, and welcome. I've reviewed Bedlam Plus bed bug spray - one of our best bed bug sprays in this post. Bedlam Plus residue will continue killing bed bugs for about 4 weeks after application. I note that it's great for carpeting, box springs, and mattresses. - Luckily, [research reports that](https://www.ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/pmc/articles/PMC4808785/)more than 40 percent of the bed bug die when treated with Bedlam plus.

- For safety when using Bedlam Plus, make sure you read the label instructions. First off, I note that Bedlam will also kill the bed bugs and the eggs resistant to pesticides such as pyrethroids. *So, let's get started! *

Luckily, the new formula in this Bedlam Plus has imidacloprid, enhancing a faster knockdown effect even for different bed bug strains.

While spraying your sofas, you'll need to give special attention to corner cracks, folds, and seams since that's where you'll mainly find bed bugs, larvae, and their eggs while still reducing their hatching rate.

I've used [many bed bug](https://pestpolicy.com/are-bed-bug-eggs-hard-or-soft/) control products, and I have to say that Bedlam Plus is definitely one of the best solutions we have out there. So, why and how did I end up selecting Bedlam Plus? - Further, I found that Bedlam Plus was easy to apply (with the ready-to-go applicator) and equally made from natural ingredients.
