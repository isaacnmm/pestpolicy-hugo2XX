##  Types of Best Blinds for Bedroom Windows

However, there are different types of Bedroom Window Blinds available in the market. In this section, I will briefly discuss the various type of blinds that you can buy.

###  1. Roller Blinds

Roller Blinds have a rolling mechanism with a control cord, and their fabric will include but are not limited to, blackout, semi
- opaque or sheer material.
- Notably, I found Roller Blinds to be trendy and easy to install. Further, the blinds will come in varied colors and floral designs. To achieve excellent decor, utilize a bed throw of s similar color as the Bedroom Window Blinds.

Also, you can have some scatter cushions to take care of the decor. *Here's how to install roller blinds*

###  2. Vertical blinds

Vertical bedroom blinds will be great for sliding or glass openings such as doors and windows.
- You'll notice that the vertical blinds are also stylish, just like the roller blinds, only that they are cheaper. Further, the Vertical blinds will work well in your patio or large windows (about 5m by 5m ). I love them for their ease of installation and maintenance, mainly cleaning.

###  3. Wooden Blinds

Wooden blinds are right, but not perfect, in blocking light going through your bedroom window.
- However, the wooden blinds will only allow limited light to leak through the edges of the wood. Further, if you need to block more light, then you should go for more oversized slats such as fifty millimeters.

###  4. Venetian Blinds

Venetian Blinds will be easy to adjust and allow enough light to come into space. Further, the Venetian blinds, like all blinds, will give you privacy and block the view of peeking eyes. Luckily, if you are into wooden furniture and decor, the Venetian blinds will blend well into the room and complement everything else with the Venetian look.

###  5. Roman Blinds

On the other hand, roman blinds are made of fabric and will give you more privacy compared to Venetian blinds.
- You'll find the roman blinds easy to install and use, and they block light too.
- Further, you can hunch the roman blinds to the top of the window to allow a better outer view. Luckily, the roman blinds will come in different colors and prints and will add style to your room.

##  Considerations in the Best Blinds for Bedroom Windows

###  Personal Decor taste

The first consideration to make on the bedroom blinds will be your taste for decor.
- For example, do you have a chic, cause, or formal decor style? Further, determine whether you love floral or fun colors. Notably, you decorate your earthy and neutral decor room using different color shades.

###  Privacy and Light

You'll need to determine if you love the cozy, airy, or bright room. Also, decide whether you'd like to block light from getting into your media or bedroom.
- Further, check if your windows are facing a busy street, a high apartment, or maybe a sunny house side. Knowledge of the above will help you determine which type of window blink you'd select and purchase.

##  Conclusion

Security and safety are critical aspects when considering the Best Blinds for Bedroom Windows. If you have small kids, you should consider purchasing only shades and blinds that have smooth edges and are streamlined cordless.
