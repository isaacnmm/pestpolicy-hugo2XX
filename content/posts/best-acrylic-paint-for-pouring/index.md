##  7 Best Acrylic Paint for Pouring in 2026

###  [1. Liquitex BASICS Acrylic Pouring Paint - #1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004M56VU2/?tag=p-policy-20)

I landed on Liquitex BASICS Acrylic mainly by trial and error, but the brand offers excellent quality acrylic paints at a budget-friendly price.

Also, this acrylic paint is suitable for beginners or students who have limited knowledge of missing their colors - it offers a range of custom colors. Liquitex is a 1955 company that specializes in quality acrylic paints - water-based models. You'll love Liquitex BASICS Acrylic for pouring but you can also get other Liquitex acrylic paints that are professional-grade that come at different richer pigments and thicknesses.

Liquitex BASICS Acrylic has a medium-high pigment load with a lightfastness of I (II). Luckily, this is an all-around paint that'll work well for beginner painters working on a work for sale. On packing and variety, Liquitex BASICS Acrylic comes in different sizes - ranging from 8 oz - 16 oz packaging and you'll find it available in most local stores.

The acrylic paint will come in 118ml or 4-oz tubes that you'll find suitable for color mixing and color theory - by retaining repeat strokes and peaks. Luckily, after mixing, the Acrylic still keeps its vibrancy and color.
Pros:

Cons:

- None

###  [2. Arteza Acrylic Metallic Paint Fade-Resistant - #2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082BFFC3Y/?tag=p-policy-20)

Arteza Acrylic Metallic is my top recommendation when it comes to touring Acrylic paints - it'll give you a highly pigmented and smooth color for consistent and true shades (vivid Pigment: ) - great for canvas painting, pouring projects, and art courses without fading.

Arteza mainly concentrates on mica powders and acrylic paints with a lightfastness of III (II) plus a high pigment load. The paint is very vibrant and hence the colors will significantly jump off your painting. Further, Arteza Acrylic Metallic is easy to mix plus gives a beautiful finish. However, having a lightfastness III doesn't go well with most painters, but it's still an excellent pouring paint in the mid-class.

On mixability, the paint offers smooth and thick consistency.

The mixing process may take longer due to the binders and pigments since they're heavy. What about glass painting? Well, Arteza Acrylic Metallic can be used on glass but it'll surely scratch since the glass surface material is slick. Luckily, being an Acrylic, this paint won't paint your skin. But it'll give you a vibrant and smooth finish.

Artist's Loft Paint has medium Pigment Load with great Mixability (1: 1/2 for paint: pouring medium) considering your application and its budget-friendly. On color differences, Titanium White is used regularly in painting since it looks bluish or bright white with great tinting strength and top opacity. Plus, the Titanium White brightens other colors.

You can with Artist's Loft Paint with water but you'd require some flow additive to avoid excessive thinness.

I recommend using floetrol like your flow medium 0- since it lacks a flow medium. Finally, Artist's Loft Paint will be great for colors such as base coats that are used often. This is because of its high-quality and equality budget-friendly.
