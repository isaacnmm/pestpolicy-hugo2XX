Is Baking Acid Environmentally Friendly? ** Boric acid is considered relatively environmentally friendly compared to some chemical pesticides.

It has low toxicity to non-target species and does not persist in the environment for extended periods. However, it's still essential to use it responsibly and avoid overapplication. **3. Can Baking Acid Be Used Outdoors? ** While boric acid is primarily used indoors, it can be used outdoors in areas where crickets are a problem.
