Diatomaceous earth, anyone? You probably were searching for remedies to the roach infestation in your home or a solution to fleas that have become a nuisance to your pet and stumbled on Diatomaceous [earth](http: //npic. orst. edu/factsheets/degen. html). And now you are wondering what this Diatomaceous earth is. This article is going to lay down all the facts about Diatomaceous earth and its benefits.

**Definition: ** Diatomaceous earth is a naturally occurring siliceous sedimentary rock made from fossilized tiny aquatic organisms. These tiny organisms are called diatoms, and they contain shells of single-cell hard-shelled algae-like water plants. Diatomaceous easily crumbles to form a white to an off-white fine powder.

##  Diatomaceous Earth - Uses, Side Effects, Interactions

This powder leaves a dusty effect on your hands. 1. **Other names: **DE, diatomite. Read Also: Does Diatomaceous Earth Kill Bed Bugs? 2. **Size: **The particle size of the[diatomaceous earth](https: //pestpolicy. com/diatomaceous-earth-for-fleas-on-dogs/)ranges from 10 micrometers to 200 micrometers. 3. **Formation: **Diatomaceous earth is formed by accumulating diatoms in the sediments of oceans, rivers, and lakes. 4.

**Composition: **The major component in the diatomaceous earth is Silica.

It takes 85%. Others are Sodium-5%, Magnesium-3%, Iron-2%.

##  Silica

Silica is among the most abundant elements on the earth. It accounts for 27. 7% of the earths crust. It is the second most abundant element in the universe after oxygen. Silicon is found in Silica. It does not exist in its pure form. Instead, it reacts with oxygen forming Silicon dioxide. Silicon dioxide has two naturally occurring forms, namely crystalline silicon dioxide and amorphous silicon dioxide.

##  **Chemical formula:**SiO2.

###  1. Crystalline Silicon dioxide

It is mostly found in sand, quartz, and emerald, amongst others. Breathing crystalline silicon dioxide causes silicosis, lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, and other respiratory problems. **Appearance: ** crystalline Silicon dioxide is transparent to gray odorless powder. It has an irritating effect on the skin and eyes once it is in contact with you.

###  2. Amorphous Silicon dioxide

Amorphous means without shape. The structure of amorphous silicon dioxide is loose and without shape. Also called Silica gel is a powdery form of Silicon dioxide. It is highly adsorbent, i. e. , it can remove material such as water, ammonia, and other gases from the air. Most Diatomaceous earth is made up of amorphous silicon dioxide. Breathing amorphous does not cause any severe health issues in your respiratory tract.

##  Diatomaceous earth Food grade vs. Filter grade diatomaceous earth

Diatomaceous earth has two main forms, namely food grade diatomaceous earth and filter grade diatomaceous earth. Food grade diatomaceous earth has been approved for human and pet consumption, while filter grade diatomaceous earth is used for water filtration and dynamite production. Food grade diatomaceous earth is also used as a pesticide and an insecticide. When ingested by either you or your pets, it kills worms.

Food grade diatomaceous earth gets rid of fleas, roaches, bugs, ants, and any other insects that may bug you. The major difference between the two is the amount of crystalline silica content. Food grade diatomaceous earth contains less than 1% crystalline silica content. Filter grade diatomaceous earth has 60-70 % crystalline silica content. The difference is caused by how the two forms of diatomaceous earth are treated.

Pool grade is treated with very high temperatures (Calcined), which turns the silicon dioxide into crystalline silica. The other difference is in the amount of heavy metal content. It must not contain more than 10mg/kg of arsenic for food grade diatomaceous grade and no more than 10mg/kg of lead.

##  Diatomaceous Earth**Benefits**

The following are some of the benefits of using diatomaceous earth. - Non-toxic DE has no chemical composition in it. Using it is hence safe for you, your pet, and the environment. - Promotes stronger teeth, bones, ligaments, and joints. Silica is a paramount element in the formation of strong teeth, bones, ligaments, and joints. The silica in food grade diatomaceous earth helps in strengthening teeth, bones, ligaments, and joints.

###  Are children more sensitive to diatomaceous earth than adults?

Children are more vulnerable and sensitive when it comes to pesticides compared to adults. When it comes to diatomaceous earth, kids are more sensitive compared to adults. Once they inhale Diatomaceous earth, kids react by shaving irritations.

###  Diatomaceous Earth on**Cancer**

As earlier discussed, exposure to crystalline silicon dioxide causes an increase in the number of lung cases. In a study of workers exposed to crystalline silicon dioxide, there were increased cases of lung cancer. In another study, some mice were left to breathe diatomaceous earth rich in crystalline silicon dioxide for one hour each day for a whole year. The results showed an increase in lung cancers among mice.

However, amorphous silicon dioxide was not associated with any cases of lung cancer.

###  Eating Diatomaceous earth

Among the various diatomaceous earth grades, only food grade diatomaceous earth is suitable for consumption by man and pets. This is because it has less than 1 % crystalline silica. Always check with your doctor or veterinarian for the recommended amounts you should take. Ensure you are eating food grade diatomaceous earth and not any other type as they are dangerous for consumption.

###  Breathing Diatomaceous earth

When inhaled, diatomaceous earth irritates the nose, nasal passages, and lungs. In case you inhale a large amount of DE, you may experience coughs and breathe shortness.
