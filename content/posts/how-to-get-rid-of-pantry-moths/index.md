Loose or non-tight storage containers should be disposed of accordingly - the gap left offers a pathway for pantry moth to access stored dry food. - More so, internal threading and folds that come with loose storage cans provide a breeding ground for pantry moths - their eggs hatch and mature without disturbance in such areas.

Those storage containers that have pronounced gaps and holes should be disposed of first as you fix containers with tiny gaps (use seal) instead of disposing of them.

###  5. Thoroughly Dry Pantry plus Washed Storage Containers

Upon cleaning, your pantry should be dried perfectly - this act reduces the chances of re-infestation or further contamination. - Pantry Moth's eggs may cling on the surface upon cleaning thus hatching later and resulting in a new colony in the process. - Moreover, washed storage containers/plastic bags should be dried in sun or wiped sufficiently with a dry piece of cloth.

Moisture traces will not only attract pantry moths back but also initiate mold formation, which leads to food contamination.
