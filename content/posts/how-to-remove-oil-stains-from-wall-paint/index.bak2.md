## Why Oil Stains Are Tricky
Oil molecules bond tightly to painted surfaces, making them resistant to water-based cleaners. The key is using agents that break down these bonds **without stripping or discoloring the paint**.

## Step-by-Step: How to Remove Oil Stains from Wall Paint

### 1. Identify the Paint Type
Before starting, confirm if your wall is painted with latex, oil-based, or specialty paint. Some solvents may dull or soften certain finishes.

### 2. Choose Your Cleaning Agent
**Recommended:** Baking Soda, White Vinegar, Ammonia, WD-40, or TSP.

### 3. Prepare the Cleaning Solution
- **Baking Soda**: 4 tbsp baking soda + 2 cups warm water. Apply with a soft cloth or sponge.
- **White Vinegar**: 3 tbsp vinegar + 3 liters warm water. Let sit for 5 minutes for tough stains.
- **Ammonia**: 1 cup ammonia + 3 cups warm water. Wear gloves and a mask.
- **WD-40**: Spray directly on stain, wait 1–2 minutes, then wipe.
- **TSP**: ½ cup TSP + 4 cups water. Use gently to avoid paint damage.

### 4. Clean the Stain
Apply your chosen cleaner using a **soft sponge**. Avoid scrubbing aggressively to protect the paint.

### 5. Rinse and Dry
Wipe the area with soapy water to remove residue, then dry with a clean towel.
