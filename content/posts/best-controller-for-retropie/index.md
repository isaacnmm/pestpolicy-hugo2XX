The "reluctantly" good gamepads lack analog sticks and broader functionality. These include compatibility with 3-D titles and extra buttons, which is unlike the Best Controller for Retropie that I review in this post.

I conducted an analysis for Best Controller for Retropie using 2D games such as Darkstalkers, Samurai Shodown II, and The Last Blade. You can use the Retropie [controllers](https: //pestpolicy. com/best-controller-for-rocket-league/) for your Retro-gaming Emulation build. For the 3D games, I used Splatoon 2 for your Nintendo 64; if you use your Raspberry Pi like a console emulator, download and run [Retropie](https: //retropie. org. uk/).
