##  **How to Choose the Best Terrariums for Snakes**

A pet snake wont serve its purpose if it is not housed properly. A good terrarium should not only give you a good display of your pet but also provide a comfortable environment for the reptile. In this guide, Ill take you through some important factors to consider when searching for the right enclosure for your snake. **The Size of the Terrarium** Snake pets come in different sizes and species.

Some species are more active than others, meaning they exhibit a lot of movement inside a cage.

Therefore, when selecting a cage, consider the length of your snake and its activity level. You can choose a cage that is at least of the snakes length. However, these criteria may not apply when you add too many accessories to enhance the cage's beauty. In this case, you should consider a cage that is longer than the snake. **Ventilation** Just like humans, snakes need to breathe correctly for their survival.

Therefore, a good snake cage should allow air to get in and out.

Most of the cages have meshed screens on their top for ventilation and lighting. Some have additional vents on their sides and near the door to increase airflow in and out of the cage. **Heating and Lighting** Snakes thrive well when provided with an environment that mimics their natural habitat. Right temperature and lighting are essential parameters for the survival and comfort of your snake.

Therefore, ensure that the cage comes with a means for heating and lighting.

You might need a thermometer to monitor the temperature in the cage to maintain the optimum temperature. **Security** You cant risk losing your adorable pet. Its both painful and a waste of money. So, you should ensure you get a secure terrarium with no possible escape routes for your pet. If the snake gets out of the cage, it may run into the bush, get trampled on the floor, or get [killed by your dog](https://pestpolicy.com/how-to-kill-fleas-on-dogs-naturally-safe-and-fast/)or cat.

It also ensures that your cage comes with a reliable lock to prevent your kid's or pets' accidental opening.

##  **Conclusion**

And apart from diet, they require an excellent terrarium that blends their natural habitat. - Your typical terrarium will essentially be determined by your budget and the size of the snake. - Other factors to consider include ventilation, security, and the ability to regulate temperature and humidity.
