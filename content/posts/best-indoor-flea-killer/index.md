### 1. Wondercide Spray for Home (Indoors), Cats, Dogs
Wondercide is a popular brand as they claim to offer a safe and non-synthetic alternative to pet owners for flea control.




The spray is made up of natural ingredients, such as lemongrass oil, rosemary oil, and cedar oil, along with sodium lauryl sulfate as an active ingredient.
Its able to kill fleas by immediately stopping their hearts, and also tends to have a strong repellent action. It is safe and can be sprayed on your pets fur and on your clothes as well.
The mixture of natural ingredients is effective for repelling fleas and also eases the itchiness on your pets skin.
Although a few complaints have come up regarding the strong odor of the Cedar line, the Lemongrass and Rosemary line have been widely embraced by users. A number of customers, however, have claimed that its effectiveness has decreased after a change in the original formula.
Pros:

- Offers a non-synthetic alternative for removing fleas.
- The scents of Lemongrass and Rosemary have very been well received.

### [2. Virbac Knockout Spray - Indoor Flea Treatment](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AT6FY6A/?tag=p-policy-20)
The Virbac Knockout Spray is solely designed to be sprayed in the areas where your pet resides. You shouldnt use it to spray it directly on your pets fur.




The active ingredients in this spray are Pyriproxyfen, Pyrethrums, and Permethrin. Its powerful enough to help rid you of any adult fleas, and also stops the pupae from developing.
However, it has no effect on their eggs, so youd have to use an insect growth regulator to kill those.
Once youre done spraying the room, we advise you and your pets to step out of that space till the product dries up. Staying inside the room can be harmful as well as an unpleasant experience for you or your pets.
Pros:
- Its non-staining and quite easy to use.
- It has a long-range of around 2100 square feet.
- Its effect can last for almost seven months.

Cons:
- Requires at least two hours of drying out.
- Leaves behind a nasty odor.
