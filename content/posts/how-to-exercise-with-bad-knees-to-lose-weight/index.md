In this post, Ill take you through different cardio workouts planned to assist you to lose weight, even when you have a [bad](https://pestpolicy.com/best-running-shoes-for-bad-knees/) [knee](https://pestpolicy.com/running-with-bad-knees/) - How to exercise with bad knees to lose weight.

But first, the term
[bad knees](https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/moving-away-from-knee-osteoarthritis)
is way too broad. However, with bad knees, you should work your knees without jarring them to reduce pain and to make them stronger.

Appropriate workouts for your bad knees should incorporate non-plyometric exercises such as sitting back in the squat and avoiding the plyometric exercises such as jumping.


## How to Exercise With Bad Knees to Lose Weight
### 1. Walking
Walking is awesome low-impact cardio that will reduce your knee pain. Unlike most bad pain sufferers who take up activity avoidance, you adopt different aerobic exercises such as walking. Such exercises are
[recommended](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18279766)
as they will improve your knees muscle quality and fight sarcopenia.

Luckily, walking and light

and cushioned shoesis a non-pharmacologic therapy, and thus you wont need to take medications. Notably, walking has been wide studies and approved for the disabled and elderly population.

Further, taking long-term walking plans can largely improve your knee pain and body functioning and slows physical function declining, also among the disabled people.

According to a recent
[study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15696558)
, increased mobility such as walking in the aerobic treatment is significantly correlated with better ankle and knee angular velocities. Also, adhering to physical activity plans improves physical function and general mobility.

Walking increases your heart rate and would be appropriate during bad weather as you can do it indoors. However, avoid walking on just one place for an extended period since it can strain your knees: mix up the steps for best results.

While walking, make sure you keep your upper body nice and tall while your shoulders should be back and down and pull your abs towards your spine to lose the most amount of calories possible.
### 2. Elliptical Trainer
Like walking and stationary bicycles, elliptical trainers are considered low impact exercises because they produce circular motion.

The elliptical trainers mimic the cross-country skiing movements, and thus youll exercise through pedal resistance.

Therefore, increasing the pedal resistance will enable your muscles to work harder and enhancing aerobic exercise.

Interestingly, with the elliptical trainer  unlike the treadmill  your feet will not leave the machine pedals, and thus there is a reduced possibility of injuring the bad knees.
### 3. Swimming
Swimming with your bad knee will be effective in losing weight. Itll assist in improving your flexibility and strengthening your muscles and bones.

Compared to other cardio exercises, swimming will have minimal stress on the bad knees. The buoyancy force will act on your body and hence reduce the tension on the knees and your joints.

Further, due to the reduced pain, youll find yourself working out longer in the water compared to other cardio training.
## Conclusion
Therefore, if you are suffering from a specific condition or injury, you should know that not all the exercises we described will appropriate. Therefore, listen to your bodys reaction and follow your doctors recommendations, if are under some for that condition.
