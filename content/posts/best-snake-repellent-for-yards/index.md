Some repellents could have toxic chemicals such as malignant and carcinogens Naphthalene, as outlined by the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/naphthalene.pdf)that produces phthalic anhydride.

These are the four best snake repellent for the yard that has been proven actually to work. They are also quite affordable and easy to use.

##  **3. #3 Pick: Safer-Brand 5951 Snake Repellent & Shield Snake Granular**

What's a Snake Repellent? - ASnake repellent is either a [natural](http://www.wildlifeanimalcontrol.com/homemade-snake.html),chemical-based (naphthalene) or sonic product created to stop snakes from getting in [spaces such as yards or houses](http://npic.orst.edu/pest/snake.html).Most of them will contain a repellent ingredient, an adjuvant, and an inert carrier.

- Eugenol, clove oil, andcinnamon oil are also great natural snake repellents if sprayed directly on the snakes.

Historically, *Styrax*trees' resin was burned for the same purpose of chasing offpoisonous snakes. - What Is in a snake repellent? -The active ingredients in mostchemical-based snake repellents are either (1)[Naphthalene](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/naphthalene#section=Top),(2) Sulfur, or (3) both. Naphthalene is also the ingredient in the good old mothballs that'll irritate the snakes' receptors.

Naphthalene is a chemical that has an unpleasant smell for snakes and will damage the reptile's retinal system and nerves. It's mainly extracted from the walnut trees (the black type). Natural best snake repellents are created fromessential oils like clove, peppermint, castor, and cinnamon.

##  [4. Dr. T's 28 lb. Snake-A-Way Snake Repelling Granules](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0042XAOJI/?tag=p-policy-20)

This formula contains a powerful combination of 28 percent Sulfur and 7 percent [Naphthalene](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/naphthalene#section=Top),which creates an unpleasant odor.

When poured around the garden or yard, any snake that attempts to go near the granule is repelled by the pungent smell.

By disrupting the snakes sensory reception, the snake slithers away in search of fresh air. The odor lasts for about 2-3 months, after which you can reapply when it becomes faint. Dr. Ts Nature Snake Repellent is an affordable solution for homeowners dealing with a serious snake infestation. It comes in a 4. 3 pounds container.

##  [8. VENSMILE Solar-Powered Sonic Snake Repellent](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P73PNVJ/?tag=p-policy-20)

Unlike all the snake repellents weve reviewed, the VENSMILE Solar-Powered snake repellent does not use chemicals. Instead, it uses electric shock to scare/repel moles, snakes, and gophers away. The snake repellent comes in the form of spikes that are strategically placed in targeted areas. The spikes are continuously charged by the built-in solar panels to produce enough electric shock to scare away snakes.

When charged for about 4 hours, the spikes can last for five days.

The best snake repellent is waterproof, easy to use, and long-lasting. The spikes work by emitting penetrating vibration pulses when placed on the ground. Every 55 seconds, the spikes produce powerful vibrations and flashing red light, which irritates the pests, causing them to run off. Even better, the spikes provide extensive shock coverage and operate in a circular pattern, usually about 100 ft in diameter.

This means that for a 1-acre piece of land, youll need to use at least 6 VenSmile spikes.

##  Chemical Snake Repellents

**1. Mothballs** -Mothballs are generally accepted by homeowners for repelling snakes. However, their effectiveness has been proven to be higher in repellingsilverfish andmoths compared to snakes. In addition to being less effective against snakes, Mothballs also containneurotoxins that can be toxic to kids and pets. **2. Sulphur** - If used alone (even in the powdered form), sulfur is highly ineffective in repelling snakes.

However, sulfur will work great when combined with naphthalene.

For instance, Snake-A-Way combines 7% naphthalene and 28% sulfur to control even rattle and garter snakes. The chemical snake repellents are created to produce a pungent smell that will be harsh on the snakes. The snakes' mouthparts ( [vomeronasal organs](https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/26/4/433/266106)), as opposed to their nose or nostrils, will sense the smell of the odor particles that the reptile picks up with its tongues.

##  Conclusion

What about sonic repellents? Well, these types of snake repellents will produce sounds with a frequency that only the snakes will detect (and not human beings). The key to note is that the unique frequency sound is both irritating and unpleasant to the snakes, and thus, the reptiles will move away from that area.
