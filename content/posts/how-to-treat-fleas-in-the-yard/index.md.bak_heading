##  Step By Step: How to Treat Fleas in the Yard

###  **Step 1: Use Yard Flea Pesticide**

Fleas are mainly attracted to moist, dark areas so you'll need to use a pesticide like Wondercide yard flea spray, which will kill off the fleas. , mosquitoes, and ticks.

Wondercide yard flea spray is a safe and effective pesticide; it's perfect for the lawn as it can be used on anything from fleas to ticks, eliminating any unwanted pests.

- I had trouble finding an effective solution to flea infestations in my yard.

Always waking up covered with them, I tried many products before finally settling on Wondercide flea spray. Once I sprayed this pesticide on my lawn, there were no more pesky fleas giving me bites! Even better, it smells absolutely wonderful.
- Use pesticides during the day when it's not too hot or cold outside and there is no precipitation in the forecast
- Spray as close to the ground as possible
- this will keep your pet from walking through it before they can get back into their house afterward!
- Be careful of using chemicals on ornamentals; if you do spray an area where plants grow make sure you're spraying at least a few meters away from them.
- Keep children out of treated areas until dry (at least 24 hrs)

###  **Step 2: Create a Flea Barrier **

One way to get rid of fleas in your yard is by building a flea barrier.

Clear the area surrounding your house of plants, brush, and leaf litter to make it less inviting to fleas. Cover the area with a layer of sand or gravel.

Once that dries, apply water to it and cover it with fresh mulch

This will keep fleas from being attracted to your yard because cedar is known for its anti
- flea and tick properties.

Ceramic tiles or stones are an option if you want a different look in the area, but be sure that they're sealed properly so that no moisture can get into them.

###  **Step 3: Mow the Lawn High **

Mow the lawn high to deter fleas. Mowing high won't eradicate your fleas, but it will reduce their numbers by providing less food and a harsher environment for them.

Long grass provides a refuge for fleas, while short grass (under 2 inches) is unattractive to other bugs that eat the fleas such as ants and spiders.
- Cutting off tall grass prevents adults from laying eggs on blades of grass. Pulling up leafy weeds like dandelions also discourages adult flea infestation.

Mowing high will likely leave you with an unmanageable pile of clippings and is not recommended for small yards or low
- traffic areas.

The following are some tips for how to mow your lawn correctly:
- Cut at least two inches above ground level so as not to leave any long pieces or clumps behind; these act as).
- Mow the lawn high, dethatch and treat with insecticide (optional). Maintain a healthy yard by not letting the grass grow too long.

###  **Step 4: **Dethatchthe Yard

Dethatching will help to kill fleas in the yard
- keep the thatch at under half
- inch or lower.
- Flea larvae hatch in the moist soil and congregate near blades of grass. The adult fleas will lay eggs on these blades, making them a breeding ground for future infestation.

Dethatching or simply mowing overgrown lawns to a height of two inches can prevent this from happening by eliminating long pieces of grass where adults may lay their eggs.

Taller weeds like dandelions should be pulled up as well if you haven't already done so within the past year; it also discourages adult flea infestation.

But keep your yard tidy and healthy by not letting the grass grow too long: cut at least two inches above ground level when dethatching before treating with insecticide (optional).

Maintain an attractive, insect
- free yard by keeping grass short and healthy. A good way to discourage fleas is to keep the lawn tidy, but not too overgrown.
- Dethatching will help destroy larvae in moist soil so they can't congregate near blades of grass where adults may lay eggs.

###  **Step 5: **Don't Overwater the Yard

Dont overwater the yard or garden
- this will help to control fleas. Reducing irrigation excessively will help combat their reproduction cycle
- keep the watering at a maximum of 1
- inch of water weekly.

It also discourages adult flea infestation.

It can be hard to avoid wetting the grass when you're trying to take care of your lawn, but this is a mistake. To control fleas, make sure not to water your yard too often.

Allow the sunrays to bit the ground

Allow sunshine to shine on the yard by pruning shrubs and trees. Further, cut the thick canopies and low branches of your trees.
- This will allow the sun to reach the ground and kill any eggs or larvae that may be in these areas, as well as dry out their hiding spots. The insecticide sprays and flea collars may be helpful on your pets, but they are not the only way to control this problem.

It's also important that you regularly wash your pet with a medicated shampoo, or [give them regular baths](https://pestpolicy.com/best
- flea
- shampoo
- for
- dogs/)if they live indoors. Your yard will stay cleaner and more comfortable for both humans and pets.

###  **Step 6:**Remove Yard Debris
- Clear all clutter that might house fleas or their larvae like lumber piles under decks or furniture outside of the home.

Also, remove Yard Debris from under porches and decks.
- Flea larvae may also be present near ground level where there are cracks, crevices, unsealed foundations with dirt piled up underneath.
- Look for dark areas that appear moist or have an accumulation of debris such as leaves or grass clippings.
- This area is a good breeding ground for parasites so clean it out if you spot any signs of infestation by picking up anything within several feet around them and disposing of offsite (garbage bags can contain flea eggs and larvae).

The more you understand about these pests, the better equipped you'll be to keep them from becoming a problem in your yard.

If left untreated, they could cause problems for years to come.

###  **Step 7: Chase Wildlife**

Chase and control wildlife from getting into your yard
- including deer, rabbits, skunks, feral cats, and squirrels to control fleas. Clean up brush piles and remove fallen branches.

Wild animals can carry fleas, ticks, and other parasites.

Keep children's play areas clean of leaves to discourage nesting animals.
- Call animal control if the problem is severe; you can also hire a professional pest management company for help with difficult cases involving large numbers. To control your dog's fleas, control or chase various wild animals including:
- Skunks
- Deer
- Rabbits
- Feral cats
- Squirrels

###  **Step 8: Treat Dogs & Cats for Fleas **

Fleas are not only a concern for your pet
- they can also be in the environment.

Flea larvae develop on floors, walls, and furniture and pets will readily pick them up when crawling around indoors or out.

To control fleas as well as other pests, use an insecticide labeled for application outdoors such as:
- Pyrethrin (which kills insects by attacking their nervous systems)
- Permethrins (which affects the central nervous system of the target pest). You may need to reapply after rainstorms. Always read instructions and follow safety precautions before applying any pesticide!

Before you apply chemicals outside make sure to cover children's toys with plastic bags so that animals cannot get into these items afterward.

If you live in an area where fleas must be controlled year
- round, consider using a monthly indoor/outdoor pest control product that contains methoprene (such as Precor) to kill the eggs and larvae; this is especially important for yards near play areas or pet enclosures.

Treat pets by applying topical insecticide products containing fipronil, and pyrethrins according to package directions on dogs every two weeks during periods of high risk such as summer months when flea populations peak.

Consult with your veterinarian if you're not sure what type of product like flea shampoo would work best for your dog or cat's coat type or other special needs.

###  **Step 9: Vacuum furniture and Carpets **

In order to make sure you won't have fleas in your yard, vacuum up any furniture that has been left outside and also vacuum the carpets.

Vacuuming carpets not only makes them look great but also ensures that all those fleas aren't going anywhere!

Be thorough with this part as well, starting at one end of the room or floor space then working across, and finally back again until every inch was covered thoroughly.

If you have any furniture on the floor that contains cushions or fabrics, you will need to remove them and vacuum these areas as well.

Steps for Vacuuming Furniture:
- Set up a sturdy area in your home where all of the furniture can be placed once it is cleaned.
- Place a sheet over the area so there won't be any fleas flying around.
- Make sure not to mix anything with different materials together and use plastic bags if necessary to avoid getting dirt from one item mixed into another when being brought inside.
- If possible, move other items out of this room such as toys, clothes, etc. , before vacuuming begins so they don't get dusty while doing their work! When complete with Vacuum Car

###  Step 11: Wash Pet Bedding, Clothes, and Linens

Pets are wonderful companions and diligent housekeepers, but their fur isn't 100% convenient.

You may need to wash your clothes, bedding, and linens (withhot, & soapy water) more often when pets live with you!

To clean pet bedding, clothes, and linens: *Step One *
- Gather materials needed for the job.
- All
- purpose detergent (or laundry soap), a large bucket or washing machine, water with hot water heater set at 40 degrees Celsius (~104 Fahrenheit) or higher, fabric softener if desired (& dryer sheets will help too! ), an old toothbrush to scrub stains out of fabric, rubber gloves for cleaning fur off clothing & furniture.

*Step Two *
- Fill up your container or washer with enough clean warm wash water that you can agitate soiled items in it without them getting stuck on the sides.
- Add detergent according to its instructions (usually about two tablespoons). Let this mixture soak into any heavy soil areas to loosen them up.
- Add clothes or linens and gently agitate in the water one at a time, getting as much of the soap solution on each item before placing it into your washing machine (or back into the bucket).
- Rinse items thoroughly with clean warm wash water & add more detergent if needed. *Step Three*
- Fill your dryer drum (to *kill fleas* ) with enough clean tumble dry clothes that you can easily move fabric around without stuff getting caught on metal parts inside.
- Dry until all fabrics are completely dried out
- this will take about 18 hours for large loads & only takes a few hours when drying smaller loads.
- Try to dry fabric in the sun when possible, and use a fan if it's not sunny outside! Sunlight helps kill bacteria on fabrics that may be left behind from washing them for too many days in a row.

###  Step 12: Apply Borax For Fleas

For fleas, Borax can be used in many ways. One way is to [sprinkle it around the yard](https://pestpolicy.com/borax
- flea
- killer/)which will kill any adult fleas.

Borax can also be used as a carpet and area treatment. Just sprinkle it on the carpets or wherever you see fleas in your home.

You should not use Borax on pets, but if they get into contact with Borax residue then have them bathed right away to avoid any irritation.

Borax is toxic for humans and animals, so be careful when using it.

It is also toxic to fish and other aquatic life, so if you have a pond or are near water then make sure not to use Borax in those areas.

If used appropriately
- Borax can be an excellent way of dealing with fleas on your property without harming the environment around you.
