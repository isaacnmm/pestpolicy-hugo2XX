When it comes to achieving a lush, healthy lawn, homeowners today have more options than ever. The choice often boils down to two main philosophies: hands-on DIY with expert guidance, or completely hands-off professional service. In this landscape, TruGreen and [Sunday](https://pestpolicy.com/sunday-lawn-care-cost/)Lawn Care represent two leading but fundamentally different approaches.

[TruGreen](https://pestpolicy.com/trugreen-cost/)stands as the nation's largest full-service lawn care provider, offering comprehensive, professionally applied treatments. Sunday Lawn Care, conversely, has carved out a niche as a modern, direct-to-consumer brand that delivers tailored, often natural, lawn care products directly to your door for you to apply yourself.

This article will delve into the nuances of each service, comparing their offerings, customer experiences, and ultimately help you decide which approach aligns best with your lawn care goals and lifestyle.

##  Compare TruGreen vs. Sunday Lawn Care

Sunday Lawn Care, on the other hand, offers a **DIY subscription model**, sending customized boxes of fertilizers, soil amendments, and weed/pest control products (often with a focus on natural ingredients) for the homeowner to apply.

**Sunday Lawn Care: ** Sunday (often stylized as "Sunday Lawn Care") represents the new wave of lawn care, appealing to homeowners who prefer a more natural, DIY approach without the guesswork. Through a subscription service, Sunday leverages soil analysis, satellite imagery, and climate data to create a personalized lawn care plan.

##  Customer Reviews

Customer experiences for both companies vary, often reflecting the inherent differences in their service models and the expectations of their respective customer bases.

**TruGreen Customer Reviews: ** * **Positives: ** Many customers report significant improvements in lawn health, color, and weed reduction over time. The convenience of not having to do the work themselves is a major advantage. The "Healthy Lawn Guarantee" is often cited as a benefit, allowing for re-service if initial results are not satisfactory.

* **Areas for Improvement: ** Common complaints sometimes include inconsistent service quality between different local branches or technicians, challenges with communication or scheduling, and concerns about aggressive sales tactics. Some customers also mention that results can take time and require patience.

There have also been occasional complaints about auto-renewals or unexpected shipments if not managed correctly.

##  FAQs About TruGreen Vs. Sunday

**Q1: Is Sunday Lawn Care truly "organic" or "natural"? ** A1: Sunday emphasizes using "mystery-free" ingredients, often derived from natural sources like plant oils, food waste, and seaweed extract. While they promote a more natural approach, some of their products may still contain synthetic components, particularly for more potent weed or pest control. They are generally considered a "friendlier" alternative to conventional lawn chemicals.

**Q2: Do I need to be home for TruGreen services? ** A2: Typically, no. TruGreen technicians can perform most services without you being present, as they primarily work on the exterior of your home. They will usually leave a service summary after each visit.

**Q3: How often do Sunday kits arrive? ** A3: Sunday's Smart Lawn Plans usually involve several shipments throughout the growing season (e. g. , 3-5 boxes per year), timed for optimal application based on your local climate and your customized plan.

**Q4: Can both companies help with lawn diseases like brown patch or dollar spot? ** A4: TruGreen offers specific lawn disease control services as part of their comprehensive plans or as add-ons, with their technicians able to diagnose and apply targeted treatments.

Sunday's focus is more on general lawn health; while a healthier lawn is more resistant to disease, they may not offer as robust or immediate solutions for severe disease outbreaks as a professional service.

**Q5: What about pest control? ** A5: TruGreen offers comprehensive pest control services, including targeted treatments for lawn-damaging insects (grubs, armyworms), mosquitoes, fleas, ticks, and perimeter pests around your home. Sunday offers DIY pest control products like mosquito and tick sprays or ant baits, often with natural or plant-based ingredients, for you to apply.
