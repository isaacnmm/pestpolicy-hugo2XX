Capstar tablets are formulated to kill the various adult flea species and they're meant for use on large dogs, cats, puppies, and kittens that are over 2 pounds in weight.
- For most of these pests, one dose of the Capstar tablets will kill most of the [fleas](https://pestpolicy.com/capstar-flea-tablets-for-small-dogs/) - but you must use other techniques tobreak the flea lifecycle.
In this article, I will online and discuss some of the Capstar flea treatment reviews that are accessible to me.
Let's dig in!
## Details: Capstar Flea Treatment Reviews
### Review #1: Highly Effective Oral Flea Treatment
I can say that I finally landed on an effective and still
[safe flea killer - for small dogs](https://pestpolicy.com/capstar-flea-tablets-for-small-dogs)
and large dogs plus cats.
Compared to other over-the-counter pesticides and repellents that I had used trying to control the fleas on my pets, Capstar tablets proved much better.
- I had my reservations in using the oral tablets for flea control especially after going through the CDC reports regarding their safety.
The results after using the Capstar flea tablets proved amazing since the chemical damaged the bug's central nervous system and thus killed them.
Luckily the active ingredients do not affect the body system of the pet and it also acts facts plus it doesn't remain in the body for long.
- Therefore the side effects on the pet (if any) we'll be for a short time and others you'll have time to discontinue a medication prior to causing extensive damage.
This will not be like other prescription flea treatments that tend to remain in the pet body for years or months - which may come with adverse health effects.
So my feedback is that Capstar flea tablets produced positive outcomes in handling and finishing the flea infestation that had proved stubborn.
- So if those pets including cats kitties dogs and puppies pickfleas from the yardand bring them in the house, Capstar tablets will help you.
Also, fleas make cats and dogs lose their fur through scratching and itchy.
Therefore a suitable oral flea medication will save the pets from dropping off their fur - it will work well for
[large medium and small furry pets](https://pestpolicy.com/capstar-flea-tablets-for-large-dogs)
.
- Just within a week, my home became flea-free and my pets why are healing their wounds while also re-growing their fur at a fast rate.
Within a month none of my pets showed any signs of physical or mental sickness and that's why I conclude Capstar flea tablets are quite effective.
Father the natural flea repellents may not work always to control the bags while some chemical pesticides may irritate the pet's skin.
### Review #2: Quick Action and Cheap in Killing Fleas
My mum has five indoor cats but just 2 go outdoors for a short time daily. But with the recent massive rains, the flea infestation has increased.
Since the cats are many numbers then controlling fleas on all of them, especially through a veterinarian is quite costly.
Luckily after sharing the Capstar flea tablets among the cats they are now back to resting and relaxing after just 30 minutes.
- As the cats relax my mum checked them out and don't list dead fleas on they are bedding and their bodies.
Capstar flea tablets works!
On cost, I note that Capstar flea tablets are considerably cheap and I would also write them five stars for effectiveness.
You can use the capitol flea tablets in conjunction with other topical flea treatments such as frontline and
revolution
- but even when alone the tablets will exterminate the place within 1 to 4 hours.
Capstar tablets should be used in combination with other techniques in a broader flea control mission.
- This is because please we require a blood meal to lay their eggs.
- So if you can remove the other place from the bed as you treat the house and yard to be easy to break theflea life cycle.
My strategy was a month of thorough flea control that included using home flea sprays, vacuuming, washing, using frontline plus, and flea collars - in addition to the Capstar flea tablets on my pets.
- Also, I washed and heat dried the bedding before finally flea-bombing my residence.
- I noted that flea bombing the house in conjunction with administering the Capstar tablets to the pets produced the best results.
### Review #3: Exterminates Adult Fleas Only
Capstar flea tablets will work within 24 hours unless you require to administer the medication to the pets.
In 24 hours, you'll be able to clean at the services using other flea control methods.
- Advice that you buy the Capstar tablets and administer one for your pet daily but ensure to read the packaging directions.
Another product that will improve the effectiveness of the flea control methods is using flea shampoo.
- This is because the Capstar tablet won't exterminate fleas in other life-stages apart from adults.
- Using suitable flea shampoo will help you kill the flea larvae and flea eggs.
But make sure to wash the pet thoroughly while using the flea shampoo to give it time for effective extermination of the pests.
After using the Capstar flea tablets most of the fleas will die.
- But you can use a flea comb to catch any that are still alive and hiding in the fur of the pet.
The flea comb will also help remove the dead skin and detached hair from the body of the pet and that gives it a better look.
- A flea spray that has highly effective but safe ingredients will easily kill fleas in the house and the yard.
- But don't spray on or around the pets or allow them to pass near the spread area.
## Conclusion
Vacuum the unwashable items used by pests such as their cat trees and carpets. Also,o laundry on the pet clothes, fabrics, and bedding.
- Therefore I know that the Capstar flea tablets easily achievedeffective flea control on my petswithin 24 hours but this could only be achieved in about two weeks with other methods.
