##  **Considerations for Best Rotary Tiller for Tractor buying guide**

**1. Tilling Width** If you have a large piece of land, consider a tiller with a large width. The width should be more extensive than the maximum width of the tractors rear wheels. View the Front Tine vs. Rear Tine Tillers. It will make it easy for you as you will make fewer passes when tilling as compared to a tiller with a small width. In most cases, tillers with large tilling diameter are pricey.

But they guarantee you a short turnaround time when it comes to mowing large unwelcoming pieces of land. **2. Power and weight of the tiller ** Tillers are made of various metals, which in turn weigh differently. You need to consider the type of soil you will be working on. A heavy tiller is ideal for a rocky and hard ground for ease in penetration as it's powerful.

You need a lighter tiller when it comes to loam soil as a heavy one will compact the soil giving you a wrong end product. When it comes to tilling depth, areas with soft soil don't need digging deeper compared to clay and rocky ground. If you rotate your crops, you may not need to dig deeper as compared to those who farm the same produce all year round. **3.

Tiller rotation and number of tines ** Choosing a tine tiller is dependent on the type of soil you will be tilling.

Tillers with a large tilling width take less time to till a large yard as they have many tines. The many tines make the tiller heavier making them ideal for harder and compact grounds. Most tillers come with the following tines: - **Counter-rotating tines** The tines move in the opposite direction to the tractor's wheel rotation. They dig deeper and are ideal for breaking new ground and destroying hard, compact clay soil.

- **Forward-rotation tines** The tines rotate in the same direction as the tractor wheels. They are the most common tillers and are ideal for turning the soil. Turning of land makes the soil fertile due to better aeration and better distribution of fertilizer and manure. **4. Areas it best suited ** You need to know the type of soil for your garden before buying a tiller. Hard and compact soil requires a heavy-duty tiller.

Should you use a small tiller on such ground, you will end up having shady work on your garden by skipping large chunks of tight spots. Also, if you are working on virgin land, the ideal tiller will be the heavy-duty one as its tough on the ground getting work is done. **5. Gears Vs. Chain drive** You have the option of choosing either gears or chain drive when it comes to garden rotary tiller drives.

Gear drive is better in tilling as they are more powerful and last longer compared to chain drive.
