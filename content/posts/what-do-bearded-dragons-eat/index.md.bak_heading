##  What Do Bearded Dragons Eat? 7 Tips

Also, you can feed your bearded dragon with animals like crickets, earthworms, cockroaches, mealworms, waxworms, butter worms, Dubia roaches, silkworms, locust or king worms.

###  1. Fruits Eaten byBearded Dragons

####  **a. Tomatoes**

Tomatoes are ideal meal for your bearded dragon as they are the main source of vitamin A, which promotes good vision, skin development and protein synthesis. However, it is dangerous to feed your dragon with excess of these fruits. Tomatoes contain oxalic acid (not easily excreted) which inhibits absorption of calcium needed for bone development.

Importantly, avoid feeding your pet bearded dragon with tomatos leaves, stem or flowers since these parts contain alkaloids such as solanine and tomatine, which negatively affects its health, and alter its physiological processes greatly.

####  **b. Apples**

Apples for bearded dragons are an essential fruit as they contain 1% of vitamin A, 5% of Vitamin K and 14% of vitamin C, which enhances good vision and development. When feeding, it is necessary to peel the apples and slice them into sizable pieces that can be chewed and swallowed smoothly without chocking the lizard. Apples have high
- level Calories (95%) and 4g fibers per fruit that will boost your dragons energy and reduce indigestion problems.

Moreover, apples large quantities of magnesium and potassium minerals, which improves development and immune system of your Breaded Dragon.

###  **c. Bananas**

Peal your bananas and slice them into small pieces before feeding your bearded dragon if unripe. Most beardies wont eat banana peels unless they are grown under natural care. You should feed your pet beardie with banana occasionally (maybe once or twice a month).

Why because, bananas contain high levels of phosphorous that binds the calcium in the body (inhibits its intake) and thus may end up causing metabolic bone disease (calcium deficiency disease).

###  **d. Berries**

Berries such as blackberries, raspberries, strawberries or blueberries can be fed to bearded dragon as they add extra water content to the blood stream. In addition, berries contain rich fiber
- networks that improves digestion process
- just like the *cantaloupe. * Berries should be fed directly without peeling or mashing.

However, wild picked berries should be cleaning thoroughly before feeding or you avoid them since they may contain toxins or harmful pests.

Blackberries are slightly harder and can be split for easier swallowing. Blueberries should be given occasionally since they contain oxalates that binds calcium leading to metabolic bone disease. **e. Papaya and watermelon** Papaya and watermelon contain sugary taste that attracts your beardies for extra feeding. They have strong fiber content that prevents your beardie from constipation. You can also feed your bearded dragons with cucumber.

Though necessary, the excess water content found in these fruits may be dangerous as they may lead to over hydration and runny poo. Therefore, it is recommended that you supplement these fruits with main meal and use them occasionally (twice per month). **f. Cherries and plums** Cherries have high level of potassium necessary for fluid balance regulation and blood pressure reduction.

However, excess eating may lead to calcium inhibition and thus cherries should be fed once per week as a supplement to main meal. Apart from water content addition, plums have fibers that help prevent constipation. It also contain iron, calcium and magnesium minerals necessary for growth and development. It is necessary to remove the central seeds found in cherry and plum as they may cause impaction to your bearded dragon.

**g. Grapes and mangoes** Grapes contains a high level of calcium necessary for bone strengthening. You will need to slice them into small pieces for easier swallowing. Grapes also have fair level of oxalate and phosphorous thus should be supplemented with other main meal. Like grapes, mangoes have fibers that help in digestion of your beardie. The sugary component in mangoes makes them favorite to beardies.

However, these fruits have high level of oxalate that binds and inhibits calcium absorption. They should, therefore, be fed twice or thrice per month and be supplemented with other main feeds.

###  2. Vegetables/GreensEaten byBearded Dragons

####  **a. Cabbages**

Cabbages are essential meal for your bearded dragon since they contain high
- energy content (113kJ). They also contain strong fibers (prevents constipation), water and vitamin A, C, & K necessary for growth and development. Moreover, magnesium, iron, zinc and manganese minerals are also plenty
- just like broccoli for bearded dragons.

Notably, cabbages have high level of calcium to phosphorous ratio (2: 1) which prevents occurrence of metabolic bone disease.

Ensure that green or red cabbages are thoroughly washed (to remove harmful chemicals or insects) and sliced into sizable pieces before feeding your bearded dragon. Minimize use of purple cabbages since they are highly acidic.

####  **b. Sweet potatoes**

Normally, bearded dragons dont eat raw sweet potatoes. They may feed on peels, but occasionally. Actually, raw sweet potatoes are great challenge to chewing as most beardies swallow food as a whole.

####  **c. Green beans and peas**

Green beans and peas are ideal meal for your beardies as they contain high
- energy content (131 kJ), vitamins A, C&K as well as calcium, magnesium and iron minerals. You can either feed your beardies with green pods or vines, which need to be chopped into small sizes first.

Beans or peas pods and vines have rich fiber content, which will help prevent your bearded dragon from indigestion problems. You need to clean green peas and beans before feeding your pet bearded dragon so as to remove any toxic chemical or poisonous insects (fireflies).

####  **d. Corianders or Kales**

Corianders are rich in fibers, vitamin (A, C, E&K) and minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium, copper and phosphorous. This occasion meal should be fed once per week. The relatively high calcium: phosphorous ratio means that overfeeding/excess use will lead to metabolic bone disease. Kales are rich source of vitamin K and C as well as magnesium mineral. Kales also have thiamine that boost the immunity of your beardie.

However, these green should only be supplemented with the main meal.

Notably, corianders or Kales are acidic in nature thus will alter the pH of digestive track leading to indigestion problems.

**e. Waxworm** Just like mealworms and silkworms, waxworms are fatty meals that should be fed to your bearded dragon occasionally in order to avoid abnormal weight accumulation, which may make it inactive. Supplement 2
- 12 waxworms with vegetables and fruits per week. Waxworms are best diet for fattening young beardies.
