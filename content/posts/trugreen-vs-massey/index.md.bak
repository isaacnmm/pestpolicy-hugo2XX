When it comes to professional lawn care, homeowners often weigh their options between national giants and well-established regional providers. [TruGreen](https://pestpolicy.com/trugreen-cost/)and Massey Services represent two distinct but highly reputable choices in this landscape. TruGreen is a household name, synonymous with comprehensive lawn care across most of the United States.

Massey Services, while perhaps less nationally recognized for *just* lawn care, is a significant integrated home services provider, particularly dominant in the Southeastern U. S. , offering robust lawn, pest, and termite control.

This comparison aims to dissect the offerings of both TruGreen and Massey Services' lawn care division to help homeowners make an informed decision. We'll explore their service philosophies, the breadth of their plans, geographic coverage, pricing considerations, and what customers generally say about their experiences.

By understanding their unique strengths and limitations, you can determine which company is better equipped to transform and maintain your outdoor space.

##  Compare TruGreen vs. Massey Lawn

The primary distinction between TruGreen and Massey Lawn Care lies in their scope and focus. TruGreen is a pure-play lawn care company with a nationwide footprint, offering standardized, comprehensive plans designed to cover all aspects of turf health. Massey Services, on the other hand, is an integrated home services company, with lawn care being one of several key offerings alongside pest control and termite management.

This means Massey often bundles services and prides itself on a more holistic approach to home and yard protection, albeit primarily in the Southeast. TruGreen also offers a more explicitly natural/organic plan (TruNatural), which Massey does not have to the same extent.

##  Overview

**TruGreen: ** As the largest lawn care company in the United States, TruGreen has built its reputation on delivering scientifically-backed lawn care solutions. With a vast network of highly trained specialists and a focus on consistent application protocols, TruGreen aims to simplify lawn maintenance for homeowners.

They offer a range of annual plans designed to address various lawn needs, from basic fertilization and weed control to comprehensive treatments for pests, diseases, and soil health, all supported by a "Healthy Lawn Guarantee. "

**Massey Services (Lawn Care): ** Founded in 1985, Massey Services is a prominent name in home and commercial services, particularly strong in Florida and other Southeastern states. While widely known for pest and termite control, their "GreenUp Landscape Service" offers extensive lawn care solutions.

Massey emphasizes a proactive, environmentally responsible approach to maintaining a healthy landscape, often integrating lawn care with their pest management expertise to provide a "total home" solution. They pride themselves on local expertise and consistent service.

##  Plans & Services

Both companies offer structured programs designed for year-round lawn health, but with some differences in emphasis and flexibility.

**TruGreen's Plans & Services: ** TruGreen's offerings are built around several core annual plans, which typically include multiple applications throughout the growing season. * **TruHealth: ** Focuses on fertilization, weed control, and basic insect control. * **TruComplete: ** Builds upon TruHealth by adding aeration and overseeding, aiming for a thicker, more resilient lawn.

* **TruSignature: ** Their most comprehensive plan, including all services from TruComplete plus tree and shrub care, and advanced insect control. * **TruNatural: ** An organic-based lawn care plan utilizing natural fertilizer and offering weed control upon request, catering to environmentally conscious homeowners.

* **A La Carte Services: ** Customers can add specific services like grub control, mosquito control, perimeter pest control, and disease treatment to any plan.

* **Healthy Lawn Guarantee: ** Promises re-service between scheduled visits if problems persist.

TruGreen's strength lies in its standardized plans and consistent execution across its broad service area, relying on its extensive research and development.

**Massey Services' Plans & Services (GreenUp Landscape Service): ** Massey Services offers a holistic "GreenUp Landscape Service" that goes beyond just the lawn, often integrating with their broader home services. * **Custom-Blended Fertilization: ** Seasonally adjusted nutrition to build a strong root system and vibrant lawn. * **Weed Control: ** Both pre-emergent and targeted post-emergent treatments for various weeds.

* **Insect & Disease Prevention/Treatment: ** Proactive and curative solutions for lawn-damaging insects (e. g. , grubs) and common diseases (e. g. , fungus). * **Annual Core Aeration: ** To reduce soil compaction and improve nutrient absorption. * **Soil pH Testing: ** To ensure optimal soil conditions for turf health. * **Mowing & Pruning Recommendations: ** While they don't mow, they provide expert advice to homeowners or their landscapers.

* **Tree & Shrub Care: ** Often integrated, focusing on nutrition, insect, and disease control for ornamental plants. * **Irrigation Maintenance: ** Unique to Massey, they offer inspection and maintenance for sprinkler systems to ensure proper watering. * **Pest Control Integration: ** Their lawn services are often bundled or easily combined with their interior pest and termite control programs, offering a "one-stop shop" for many homeowners.

Massey's services are often more tailored to local conditions, particularly in the challenging climates of the Southeast, and their integration of irrigation and broader pest control distinguishes their offering.

##  Availability & Locations

The geographic reach of these two companies is quite different, impacting who can access their services.

**TruGreen Availability: ** TruGreen boasts the largest footprint in the U. S. lawn care industry, providing services in **48 contiguous U. S. states**. This extensive coverage means that a vast majority of homeowners across the country can likely access TruGreen's services. They also operate in Canada.

**Massey Services Availability: ** Massey Services has a strong **regional focus**, primarily dominating the **Southeastern United States**. Their operations are concentrated in states such as Florida (where they have a very high number of locations), Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. While significant within these regions, their reach is not nationwide like TruGreen's.

Homeowners outside these states will need to consider alternative providers.

##  Customer Reviews

Customer experiences with both TruGreen and Massey Services can vary, reflecting factors like local branch management, technician quality, and customer expectations.

**TruGreen Customer Reviews: ** * **Positives: ** Many customers praise TruGreen for noticeable improvements in lawn health, density, and color, along with effective weed control. The convenience of scheduled treatments and the "Healthy Lawn Guarantee" are frequently appreciated. Their mobile app and online tools are also seen as benefits.

* **Areas for Improvement: ** Common complaints sometimes include inconsistency in service quality between different technicians or branches, occasional challenges with customer service responsiveness (though they have online chat and app support), and concerns about persistent sales calls. Some customers also mention the need for several applications to see full results.

**Massey Services Customer Reviews (Lawn Care): ** * **Positives: ** Customers often highlight Massey's local expertise, especially in managing common issues specific to the humid Southeastern climate (e. g. , specific weeds, fungus, unique pests). The professionalism and knowledge of individual technicians often receive praise. The ability to bundle lawn care with pest and termite control is a significant draw for many.

Responsiveness for re-treatments or specific issues is frequently lauded.

* **Areas for Improvement: ** Like any multi-location service, quality can vary. Some customers have reported initial miscommunications regarding service scope or billing. While they pride themselves on integration, the breadth of services can sometimes lead to less specialization in one area compared to a pure-play company. Pricing transparency can sometimes be an issue as detailed quotes often require an on-site inspection.
