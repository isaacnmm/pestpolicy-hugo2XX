Fleas feed and breed off the blood of warm-blooded hosts, and that's how they make their way onto your cat or dog.

- The flea eggs fall off flea-infested animal hosts andhatch to pupaewhen they land in a suitable environment, such as your yard and the pet's sleeping area. Within two days of exiting the pupae cocoon with an adult form, the adult flea finds a host animal and takes its first blood meal. After feeding, the flea quickly finds a dark place to wait for its next host.

- Cat fleas are also better adapted to finding hosts in areas with low levels of light and higher concentrations of carbon dioxide around their host's head as they move around the animals body. Related: Should a dog with fleas sleep in my bed?
