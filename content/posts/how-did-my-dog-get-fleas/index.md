But you can take preventative measures by administering some appropriate dog flea treatment. Indoor dog facilities must also be flea-treated before allowing your dog to visit such areas. So, take precautions; as regards the application of flea control techniques, as you choose the dog's daycare, pet boarding, or groomer.

- A proactive step that I can take is to enquire about flea outbreaks in the facility and the steps they took to manage them and also how they prevented exposure to other pets including dogs. - Groomers' facilities can also be a hotspot for fleas to jump onto your dog but extra caution must be taken as regards the groomer's gear as they could already be infected.

So, as noted earlier, ensure that the groom has laid down procedures for flea control and appropriate washing of the dogs.

###  4. Can Dogs Get Fleas From Outdoor Spaces? Hotspot #4

Fleas love the humid and warm climate that is mainly outdoors; which allows them to survive for long in such areas. You will find flea eggs in shady and cool locations of your outdoor spaces. Therefore, the dogs can get a flea infestation if they frequent such places in your yard. So, which outdoor areas can my dog get in contact with fleas? 1. Neighboring yards 2. Under porches 3. Dog houses 4. Kennels 5. Backyard 6.

Dog park or run The please that you find in your backyard could have come from the neighbors yards or via wildlife.

##  How To Control Fleas On Your Dog

It doesn't matter whether you are dog is well protected or super clean, they may always catch fleas. - Therefore, from the onset, I would suggest that you put your dog on some flea prevention remedies like AdvantageMulti and Comfortis.

###  Step 1: Early Detection

Detecting fleas in their early stages will help you prevent the occurrence of a full-blown flea attack within weeks. Therefore, It's important to promote early detection of fleas by checking unique signs on the pet (dog) and in the house. - Some of the most common signs of a flea infestation on your dog will include excessive scratching and nibbling.

- Also, the occurrence of red patches and sudden loss of hair on the dog's skin may indicate an infestation.

So, if you notice these signs of fleas, I recommend you undertake an extensive investigation by keenly combing through the dog's fur. - In addition, examine if you see small black dirt (which is fleas body waste). - Also, you can set down the dog on some white towel and then continue brushing its fur downwards Therefore, it will now be easy to notice the flea dirt and the adult fleas when you have the white towel background.

###  Step 2: Flea-Treat the Pet (Dog)

Shop for a pesticide that will exterminate the adult fleas and the flea larvae. For the dogs (and other pets) plus the house to become flea-free, you'll need to effectively kill all the flea larvae. - Therefore, when purchasing that pesticide, casual that it includes larvae-killing ingredients such as methoprene and pyriproxyfen.

Bathe the cats and dogs in four to five days prior or after flea- or tick-treating to them with spot-on remedies like Advantage II or K9 Advantix II.

Notably, the chemicals in these spot-on flea treatments will move into the pet's subcutaneous fat layer to exterminate flea eggs and adult fleas. - Bathing the dogs too fast before applying the spot-on treatment will wash off the natural oils which help carry the bug-killing chemicals. In addition, bathing the dogs shortly after the flea treatment will wash off the chemicals.

But if you used oral treatments for the dogs like bravecto you don't have to worry about bathing them too soon.

I recommend the immediate application of the flea killers if you notice adult fleas in the vicinity. - For example, Capstar flea killer will exterminate the fleas on your dog in 6 hours. Luckily some of the flea killers like sentinel will also exterminate other pests like heartworms. - However, as regards the use of shampoos to kill fleas - avoid over-using them as they may overdry the dog's skin.

###  Step 3: Flea-Treat the House or Home

Next, I recommend that you vacuum the house using a vacuum cleaner and make sure to get to those hard surfaces. - After vacuuming the surfaces remember to seal that vacuum bag in some plastic container and dispose of it. They are homeowners that will tell you to put a flea collar into that vacuum bag to help kill the flea eggs and the adult fleas as you are vacuuming.

- However, some experts discourage the use of flea collars in vacuum cleaners since these devices have many chemicals.

Prior to beginning the vacuuming process, sprinkle some borax on the carpets that could be flea-infested - and leave it overnight. - Vacuum the various services on the next day and use hot water to wash the best bed but you can also or to dry the fabrics. But if the fleas continue attacking and appearing in your spaces, consider contracting a professional exterminator since they will use powerful but safe chemicals.

- If you'll be doing the flea extermination as a DIY Project remember some of the chemicals that you might use may be hazardous to your kids, fish, and birds. Related: [Diatomaceous Earth](https://pestpolicy.com/diatomaceous-earth/)
