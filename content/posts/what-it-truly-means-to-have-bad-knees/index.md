Below I discuss what it truly means to have [Bad](https://pestpolicy.com/best-running-shoes-for-bad-knees/)Knees? I was yearning to stay active, but I didnt have my ever strong knees. "Bad knees" the root of most of my fitness challenges is a collection of injuries that occur to the knee. The injuries are classified into two: (1) traumatic/ acute injuries and (2) overuse injuries - check these [shoes if you've flat feet](https://pestpolicy.com/best-walking-shoes-for-men-with-flat-feet/).

##  What it truly means to have Bad Knees?

Most people, experience the [patellar pain syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patellofemoral_pain_syndrome),a kind of knee overuse injury, which involves pain, soreness, and discomfort at the fore and below the kneecap. Due to bad knees, I was hesitant to do lower body days or even work out the legs since all thought of with the lunges and squats was the pain or additional injury it would cause if I didnt do it right.

You can take different movements that would work your posterior chain to allow the hamstrings and glutes to prevent knee pain. However, the [book](https://www.amazon.com/FrameWork-Knee-6-Step-Preventing-Injury/dp/1605295930/ref=as_li_ss_tl?

&ascsub&linkCode=ll1&tag=p-policy-20&linkId=873671e9e1be6d13419f783a68892104) by Nicholas notes that bad knees occur due to overloading the joint with repetitive movements such as excessive lunges, squats, and running, mainly with limited recovery time.

- If done right and with the correct intensity, duration, and frequency, the above exercises can help improve your bad knee by strengthening muscles supporting the knees like quads, hamstrings, and glutes. Things youll need to avoid: an abrupt change in your workouts such as everyday training, going to a crazy workout or gymnasium or increasing your runs or racing coverage.

##  Traumatic or Acute Injury

The acute bad knee injury happens because of twisting action or trauma. The amount of pain experienced will depend on the mechanism of induction and its severity. However, avoid excessively strenuous exercise as they could advance the knee injury and pain.

###  (a) Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) sprain

- [ACL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury)sprainshappened regularly in sports that entail sudden directional changes such as contact sports. Such an injury could also include, knee joint injury and swelling.

###  (b) A medial ligament MCL sprain

- [MCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament)injuryis characterized by a ligament tear in the inner side of the knee. MCL injury happens because of twisting and impact motion. However, MCL sprain could also emerge due to knee joint twisting or falling.

###  (c) Patella tendon rupture

- An injury characterized by a 'pop' sound? The Patella tendon ruptures are also highly painful. Sadly the injury could rapture for the aged people and those with jumpers knee. - The bad knee will swell mainly above the tendon and below the knee.

##  Any remedies

Most of the outlined bad knees issue listed above can be prevented by keeping your bad knee safe.

###  Appropriate exercises

Notably, your bad knee will not love an intensive workout. Therefore, youll have to shift the workout plan to make the knee to familiarise. - You may begin with working out or exercising for about 3 days per week. During this period, you can increase the workout time and intensity while considering your bodys reaction.

- If, you'll be jogging or running, ensure you acquire the[right shoes for bad knees](https://pestpolicy.com/best-running-shoes-for-bad-knees/).As we had noted earlier, it is essential to take breaks in your workout plans to give your bad knee enough time to recover. - Therefore, for our current workout plan, you can take about 2 resting days during which time the body will recover.

Notably, avoid rushing to a new sport without training the relevant muscles.

For example, if youll be starting tennis in the next month, ensure you strength train relevant muscles, which will prepare you to handle the physical stress resulting from the game.

###  Balance your workouts

Like your proper and healthy diet, exercises should come in a balanced manner. Therefore, avoid following a similar workout plan over and over again: itll weaken your joints, and its monotonous too.

Youll need to consume the right information regarding the proper exercises that will benefit both your bad knee and other muscles. After all, it is clear that bad knee should not hamper your workout and fitness journey. Therefore, mix up your workouts with cross-training, lunges, squats, and days off for rest.
