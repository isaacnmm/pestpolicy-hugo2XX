To choose the best paint [roller](https://pestpolicy.com/best-paint-roller-for-ceilings/)cover for interior walls, check both the [paint](https://pestpolicy.com/best-paint-roller-for-emulsion/)'ssheen (either knit or woven) and then consider the nap height - fibers length extending from the backing. - I would recommend using a 3/8-inch napheight if you're working with*interior walls, including *lightly-textured surfaces.
