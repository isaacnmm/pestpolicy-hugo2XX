However, like any tool, [HVLP](https: //pestpolicy. com/best-hvlp-spray-gun-for-lacquer/) spray guns require regular cleaning and maintenance to ensure they continue to function properly. In this article, we will go through the steps of cleaning an HVLP spray gun, so you can keep your tool in top condition.

# # How To Clean an HVLP Spray Gun

## # **Step 1: Remove the paint cup or container and pour any remaining paint back into the can or container.**

Before you start cleaning your HVLP spray gun, it's important to make sure that there is no paint left in the cup or container. If there is, pour it back into the can or container for future use.

This will prevent any paint residue from drying and hardening in the cup or container, which can make cleaning more difficult.

## # **Step 2: Use a cleaning solution specifically designed for cleaning paint spray guns, such as mineral spirits or lacquer thinner, to flush the paint out of the gun. If you don't have a cleaning solution, you can use water.**

After removing the paint from the cup or container, the next step is to flush the paint out of the gun. You can do this by using a cleaning solution specifically designed for cleaning paint spray guns - - even with undercoat paints. These cleaning solutions, such as mineral spirits or lacquer thinner, are effective at breaking down and removing paint residue. If you don't have a cleaning solution, you can use water as an alternative.

## # **Step 3: Spray the cleaning solution or water through the gun until it runs clear.**

Once you have your cleaning solution or water, attach the gun to the cleaning solution container or a bucket of water. Turn on the gun and spray the cleaning solution or water through the gun until it runs clear.

This will flush out any paint residue that may be inside the gun. It is important to keep the gun moving while you are flushing it out, to ensure that all the paint is removed.

## # **Step 4: Disassemble the gun, including the tip, and soak all of the parts in the cleaning solution or water for a few minutes.**

The next step is to disassemble the gun. This includes removing the tip, as well as any other parts such as the air cap and fluid nozzle. Once the gun is disassembled, soak all of the parts in the cleaning solution or water for a few minutes. This will allow the cleaning solution or water to break down any paint residue that may be on the parts.

Step 5: Use a brush or a toothbrush to scrub any paint residue from the parts. After the parts have soaked for a few minutes, take a brush or a toothbrush and scrub any paint residue from the parts.

Make sure to pay attention to the small crevices and grooves, as paint can often get trapped in these areas. Scrubbing the parts will ensure that all the paint is removed, and the gun will be ready for use.

## # **Step 6: Rinse the parts with water and dry them thoroughly with a clean cloth or air gun.**

Once you have scrubbed all the paint residue off the parts, it's time to rinse them with water. This will remove any remaining cleaning solution or paint residue.

Be sure to rinse the parts thoroughly, so that there is no cleaning solution or paint residue left on them - - just like with swing set stains. You can then proceed to immerse the gun. After rinsing, dry the parts thoroughly with a clean cloth or air gun. Drying the parts will prevent rust and ensure that the gun is ready for use.

## # **Step 7: Reassemble the gun and test it before using it again.**

The final step in cleaning your HVLP spray gun is to reassemble it. Make sure that all the parts are properly secured and connected.

Once the gun is reassembled, it is important to test it before using it again. This will ensure that the gun is working properly and that there are no leaks or other issues. If everything is working correctly, your HVLP spray gun is now ready for use.

In addition to regular cleaning, it's also important to keep your gun lubricated. Check the manufacturer's instructions for recommended lubricant to use. A lubricated gun will help ensure that it functions smoothly and reduces wear and tear on the parts.

Regular cleaning and maintenance of your HVLP spray gun will help prolong its lifespan and ensure that it continues to provide a smooth, even finish on your projects.

By following these simple steps, you can keep your HVLP spray gun in top condition, so you can continue to tackle your DIY home renovation projects with ease. Additional Considerations while using the HVLP spray gun

There are some additional points that you should consider when cleaning your HVLP spray gun: 1. Always wear gloves and protective eyewear when cleaning your HVLP spray gun. This will protect your skin and eyes from the chemicals used in cleaning solutions. 2. Clean your HVLP spray gun immediately after use. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to remove the paint residue. 3. Be careful when cleaning the air cap and fluid nozzle.

These are delicate parts of the gun and can be easily damaged if not handled properly. 4. Don't forget to clean the paint filter. The paint filter is located inside the gun and is designed to remove any debris or impurities from the paint. A clogged paint filter will affect the quality of the finish. 5. After cleaning, run some water or cleaning solution through the gun before using it again.

This will help ensure that there is no residue left in the gun that could affect the quality of the finish. 6. It's also important to regularly check the air cap, fluid nozzle, and needle for wear or damage. These parts can be easily replaced if necessary. 7. Keep the gun in a dry place, and cover it with a plastic bag when not in use to avoid[dust and debris accumulation](https: //pestpolicy. com/best-hvlp-spray-gun-for-woodworking/).

By following these steps, you can ensure that your HVLP spray gun is clean and functioning properly, which will result in a better quality finish on your painting projects. Additionally, regular cleaning will prolong the life of your gun.
