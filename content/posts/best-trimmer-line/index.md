##  **Considerations for Best Trimmer Lines**

Apart from their different colors and packaging, all trimmer lines appear to look the same but this is not the case. A number of notable differences from one trimmer line to another determines the overall functionality. When choosing a trimmer line, there are several features to look out for such as the shape, the level of durability, the material components it is made out of and the string diameter.

###  1. Shape

Regardless of its thinness, a trimmer line may take one of many shapes. This makes all the difference in determining how efficiently the trimmer line cuts through weeds and grass - including rear tine tillers. Whereas a round trimmer line is best suited for light jobs around your property, a multi-sided trimmer line is ideal for medium size landscaping activities.

On the other hand, a serrated and twisted line is more suited for larger commercial undertakings particularly where there are thick weeds.

###  2. Material

Trimmer lines are made out of both light duty and heavy duty materials. Whereas basic light duty trimmer line is basically made out plastic materials and nylon, the heavier duty models are made out of a combination of synthetic polymers, nylon and aluminium. Such added substances add to the trimmer lines strength and durability.

###  3. Diameter

This is one of the most important factors to consider when buying a trimmer line because it determines its ability to cut through certain patches of weed. Whereas lighter trimmer lines have diameters ranging from 0. 065 inches to 0. 080 inches, heavy trimmer lines diameters range from 0. 110 inches and above.

###  4. Durability

Trimmer lines that break down more easily need faster replacing which translates into more financial expenses. In addition, replacing the trimmer line is not only frustrating but also time intensive. You might want to consider reading online reviews to determine the durability of the various options available in the market.

###  5. String length

Reading the weed eaters user manual for the compatible string size is imperative. In addition, walking around your property before the trimming exercise could give you an idea of the materials likely to encountered and the length of trimmer line needed.

###  6. Compatibility with standard size string trimmers

If you are unsure of the compatibility of your trimmer line with the available weed eaters, you might want to go for a one-size fits all trimming string.

##  **Conclusion**

Whereas the above list has attempted to narrow down to the best trimmer lines in the market, you might need to research the best tailor made solutions for your needs if your lawn is to be left looking lush and pristine all season long.
