###  [1. Klipsch BAR 48 SoundBar plus Wireless Sub-woofer - #1 Pick](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QY1ZPRG/?tag=p-policy-20)

Klipsch BAR 48 is a great mixed-use soundbar that produces a bright audio profile. It has Tractrix tweeters that are prominent without metal grille or cloth.

Klipsch BAR 48 is great for your living room for your big TV as it'll fix the poor quality audio output. The sound will give you a great immersion and engulfing. The wood designed Klipsch BAR 48 makes it have a high-quality look. You can switch between the 3 sound modes when you're watching or playing movies, games, and music. You can easily link the soundbar to the phone or TV and you can mount it on the wall but has 3 cables.

Luckily, its a 3. 1 system that has a wireless subwoofer, plus the right & left channels. The Klipsch BAR 48's has a center speaker that'll make sure that the screen dialogue is crisp and clear making it remain appropriate - both center and front. The soundbar's 3 front channels will take care of the higher and mid-range frequencies with great separation and balance. It'll give you natural-sounding and solid bass.

Cons:

- Limited connections including HDMI

###  [2. Samsung HW-Q90R (510W) 7.1.4-Channel - #2 Pick](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W88C715/?tag=p-policy-20)

Samsung HW-Q90R is a powerful 7. 1. 4 channel and exciting soundbar but sadly has no room or night mode correction. The surround speakers and the wireless subwoofer is a great plus.

Samsung HW-Q90R has surround and sub-woofer speakers - with the right- and front-left surround channels with the side-firing drivers. Samsung HW-Q90R has different Connections including WiFi, Bluetooth, USB, optical digital audio, HDMI output + eARC, and HDMI inputs. This soundbar came as the all-dancing and all-singing model that came out in 2019 - it has an upward-firing driver plus rear speakers but it'll only allow object-based audio.

Besides, the device has exceptional features like HDMI connections that are fully-specified and hence great also with the surround speakers and wireless subwoofer. The 4 up-firing speakers will give you excellent height effects allowing the listener to readily love the DTS: X and Dolby Atmos that'll bounce the sound from up to 12. 5 feet ceiling.

The Samsung HW-Q90R is great for television particularly because it's easy to install and generates crisp sound.

In addition, it's easy to mount on any wall. In addition, the speakers will allow different sound profiles and hence will give you varied audio required for gaming, music, and movie - connect even to Bluetooth to pair your smartphone. The device has in-built equalizer sounds - you'll find the optical cable plus a remote - you'll also love its quartet sound modes including adaptive mode, Standard mode, and the Game Pro.

Also, the soundbar's surround mode will up-mix the various sound sources going to your 7. 1. 4 audio and thus great for anyone listening to height channels but lacks a nigh mode.
Pros:

- HW-Q90R worked excellently with the non-Atmos content by up-mixing sounds and including many height effects for the airborne and big battle scenes.

- The 7. 1. 4 HW-Q90R soundbar has 17 drivers but the wireless sub-woofer comes with 8-inch drivers.

- Also, you can use the remote control to remotely control the soundbar.

Cons:

- Bulky, wide, and heavy

###  [3. Yamaha YAS-209BL Audio SoundBar](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T5GGR8L/?tag=p-policy-20)

Yamaha YAS-209BL will also give you quality and excellent sound thanks to its many packed features. The versatile soundbar does great work in balancing power and detail.

I would note that Yamaha YAS-209BL includes extra features like Amazon Alexa that's inbuilt and also voice assistance - a great soundbar for the money. The entry-level Yamaha YAS-209 bar produces a great sound profile while its subwoofer will give you great bass. This YAS-209BL beats the YAS-207both on the features and versatility like the in-built Amazon Alex great for working with the 4K television.

Besides, right & left channels but its virtual surround will assist in projecting the surround sound. The soundbar will support HDR10 but it sadly lacks Dolby Vision HDR. But it generates a significantly impressive sound for the budget-friendly device. Also, the in-built Alexa is a plus besides the excellent controls for an even sleeker design compared to the Yamaha YAS-207.

The device with produce growling, deep, and treble bass but an equally suitable warm mid-range.

Further, the bar has 2 virtual surrounds that are dedicated to producing better sound. It has a satisfactory stereo soundstage and it'll give a focused sound. The sound effects in your action movies will fill the entertainment room while the "Clear Voice" will work great for the dialogue-heavy and slower scenes. Luckily, this bar has both DTS Virtual: X and Dolby Digital that'll equally ice its sound.

Further, you can use the soundbar like your Bluetooth speaker, and hence it'll be easy to stream your music or Spotify (with Wi-Fi) from the tablet, laptop, or smartphone. On design, YAS-209BL has a very compact profile but also produces excellent sound. With its small-sized body, the YAS-209BL will largely disappear on the TV console and hence some of us might not even notice its presence.

Also, the wireless subwoofer makes it easy to hide the soundbar since you can simply through it behind the TV screen.
Pros:

- Excellent stereo performance

- Great build quality

- In-built Amazon Alexa

- Excellent frequency response

- Has a sound profile that's greatly balanced

- Budget-friendly

Cons:

- None

###  [4. VIZIO SB36512-F6 5.1 Audio Soundbar Speaker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JDMBK2N/?tag=p-policy-20)

VIZIO SB36512-F6 also a great soundbar for console gaming - you'll hear all the footsteps in the physical, real space as you're gaming. Also, VIZIO SB36512-F6 will significantly improve the soundstage of your TV - luckily, it's a budget-friendly soundbar.

Further, for Xbox One gamers, the Dolby Atmos will enable you to readily hear what's going on above you and thus you'll easily avoid the gun-holding helicopters. Also, you'll love the many inputs including Google Chromecast, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB, and HDMI ports. This high-tech and high-value VIZIO SB36512-F6 Sound System will give you great immersion with its audio magic. It's also medium-sized measuring about 3. 25-inches depth, 2.

5-inches height, and 36-inches width.

Therefore, the compact size allows the bar to readily blend into most room decor. The 5. 1. 2 soundbar provides adequate surround-sound plus bass for music and video entertainment. You'll require RCA-terminated cables to connect the soundbar to the subwoofer but you'll also require some power cord unless you'll use batteries.

However, the soundbar's overhead effect will require a reflective and flat ceiling surface at up to 12 feet above your speakers.

Thus, this soundbar won't work well with non-reflective, drop ceilings, and angled ceilings - particularly when they're above the recommended height. Further, the speakers have Dolby Atmos and hence with the right conditions in your room, a 20-degree angle will allow the sound to readily bounce off your ceiling to your position. But you'll get both high value and high-tech soundbar in this VIZIO SB36512-F6.

Pros:

- Allows Dolby Vision HDR-10, 4K or UHD connection

- Works with Google Assistant and Chromecast

- Upmixing with the DTS Virtual: X for two-channel audio and regular sound surround

- Dolby Atmos will enhance your feel on height and space.

Cons:

- Poor contrast on the IR remote screen
