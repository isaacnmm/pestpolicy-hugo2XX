## Our Top 4 Plastic Gutter Guards
Plastic gutter guards are widely available at hardware stores and online, offering a range of designs to suit different preferences and budgets.
1. **Amerimax Snap
- In Filter Gutter Guard:** * **Why it's a top pick:** Amerimax is a well
- known brand offering various gutter products. Their **snap
- in plastic gutter guards** are popular for their ease of installation. They typically feature a flexible mesh or grid design that snaps directly into the gutter lip, allowing water to pass while blocking larger leaves and debris. Made from durable PVC, they resist corrosion.
* **
**Pros:**
- ** Very easy DIY snap
- in installation, affordable, effective against large leaves and twigs, UV
- stabilized to prevent brittleness. * **
**Cons:**
- ** Mesh size may allow smaller debris (pine needles, shingle grit) to pass through, less durable than metal guards, can sag or deform over time under heavy debris or snow.
2. **Frost King Plastic Gutter Guard (Mesh Roll):** * **Why it's a top pick:** Frost King offers a simple, **roll
- out plastic mesh gutter guard** designed to be installed under roof shingles or attached to the gutter edge. It's highly versatile, as you can easily cut it to size with scissors to fit various gutter dimensions. This product is especially budget
- friendly for covering long stretches of [gutters](https://pestpolicy.com/best
- aluminum
- gutter
- guards/).
* **
**Pros:**
- ** Extremely affordable, easy to cut and customize, simple roll
- out installation, resistant to rust and corrosion. * **
**Cons:**
- ** Can be flimsy and prone to sagging, less effective against fine debris, may require more frequent maintenance to clear debris from the surface, potential for dislodging in high winds if not securely fastened.
3. **Home Intuition Gutter Guard (Fine Mesh Plastic):** * **Why it's a top pick:** Home Intuition often provides plastic gutter guards with a **slightly finer mesh pattern** compared to standard plastic screens. This design aims to block a wider range of debris, including some smaller particles, while still maintaining good water flow. They're generally designed for easy, self
- installation.
* **
**Pros:**
- ** Better at blocking smaller debris than coarser plastic screens, affordable, rust and corrosion resistant, relatively easy to install. * **
**Cons:**
- ** Still not as effective as metal micro
- mesh for very fine debris, durability can be an issue in extreme temperatures, may require frequent cleaning of the mesh surface.
4. **Raindrop Gutter Guard (Polypropylene Sections):** * **Why it's a top pick:** While many plastic guards are simple screens, Raindrop stands out for its robust, high
- performance polypropylene design. These are individual sections with a unique sloped, ribbed grid that utilizes a combination of surface tension and filtration. They're exceptionally durable for a plastic product and handle very high water volumes, effectively shedding both large and medium debris.
* **
**Pros:**
- ** Extremely durable and rigid for a plastic guard, excellent water flow, effective against large to medium debris, good for cold climates (won't become brittle), can be professionally installed or by advanced DIYers. * **
**Cons:**
- ** Higher cost than other plastic options, not as effective as micro
- mesh for fine debris, bulkier appearance than thin mesh screens.

## Buying Guide for The Highest Rated Plastic Gutter Guards
Choosing a plastic gutter guard involves understanding its strengths (affordability, ease of installation) and weaknesses (durability, limited filtration).
1. **Debris Type:** * **[Best](https://pestpolicy.com/best
- foam
- gutter
- guards/)for Large Leaves:** Plastic gutter guards, especially those with larger openings, are best suited for homes primarily dealing with **large, flat leaves**. They provide a simple barrier to prevent these from entering and clogging your gutters.
* **Poor for Fine Debris:** If your property has pine needles, shingle grit, small seeds (like maple spinners or elm seeds), or heavy pollen, most plastic gutter guards will be ineffective. These small particles will either pass through the openings or accumulate on the surface, requiring frequent cleaning. For fine debris, a **micro
- mesh system (typically metal)** is essential.
2. **Climate and Durability:** * **Temperature Extremes:** Plastic can become brittle and crack in very cold temperatures or warp and sag in extreme heat. Look for **"UV
- stabilized" plastic** (like polypropylene or high
- quality PVC) to extend its lifespan, especially in sunny climates. Metal guards generally offer superior resilience to temperature fluctuations. * **Wind and Snow Load:** Flimsier plastic guards can dislodge in high winds or collapse under heavy snow and ice.
Consider the climate in your area. Raindrop's rigid design makes it an outlier in this category, offering significantly better durability.
3.  **Water Flow Capacity:** * Most plastic screens allow for good water flow. However, if the openings are too small (aiming for finer filtration), or if they become covered with a layer of fine debris/pollen, water can sheet over the top, especially during heavy downpours.
4. **Installation Method:** * **DIY Friendly:** The main advantage of most plastic gutter guards is their ease of DIY installation. Many snap
- in, slide
- in, or roll
- out designs require minimal tools and effort, saving on labor costs. * **Under Shingles vs. Gutter Lip:** Some plastic mesh rolls are designed to tuck under the first row of shingles, while snap
- in or drop
- in types fit directly into the gutter.
Ensure the installation method is compatible with your roof and gutter type and won't void your roof warranty.
5.  **Maintenance Expectations:** * Plastic gutter guards are generally **not "maintenance
- free."** Debris will often accumulate on top of the guard, especially fine particles, requiring you to brush, blow, or hose them off periodically. Over time, smaller debris can also enter and build up inside the gutter, necessitating removal of the guards for cleaning.
6.  **Cost vs. Lifespan:** * Plastic gutter guards are the **most affordable option**, typically ranging from **$0.50 to $12 per linear foot** for materials. * However, their lifespan is shorter (typically **2
- 10 years**, with Raindrop being a notable exception at 10
- 20 years) compared to metal guards (15
- 30+ years). You might end up replacing plastic guards more frequently, which can add up over time.
7.  **Aesthetics:** * Most plastic screens and snap
- in guards are fairly visible from the ground, especially if debris accumulates on top. If aesthetics are a major concern, you might prefer a more discreet metal micro
- mesh or reverse
- curve system.
- -
- **Plastic gutter guards** offer an appealing blend of affordability, ease of installation, and basic debris protection, making them a popular choice for budget
- conscious DIY homeowners. Typically made from **PVC (polyvinyl chloride)** or **polypropylene**, these guards come in various forms, including mesh screens, snap
- in filters, and even solid covers designed to leverage surface tension principles.

While plastic gutter guards are generally less durable and offer less comprehensive filtration than their metal counterparts, they can be an effective solution for homes with lighter debris loads or as a temporary measure. They're lightweight, resistant to rust, and easy to cut and fit.

This article will explore the top plastic gutter guard options, compare their features, provide a comprehensive buying guide, and offer final thoughts on whether plastic is the right material for your gutter protection needs.

##  Final Thoughts on The Best Plastic Gutter Guards

**Plastic gutter guards** are a viable option for homeowners seeking a **budget
- friendly, DIY
- friendly, and easy
- to
- install** solution for basic gutter protection. They are most effective at preventing large leaves and twigs from clogging gutters.

However, it's crucial to set realistic expectations. They are generally not suited for homes with heavy pine needle accumulation, shingle grit, or extreme weather conditions. Their durability is limited compared to aluminum or steel options, and they will likely require more frequent maintenance to keep their surface clear of debris.

For a temporary fix, a rental property, or a home with a very light debris load and mild climate, a well
- chosen plastic gutter guard can certainly save you time and effort on gutter cleaning. For long
- term, comprehensive protection against all types of debris and harsh weather, investing in a higher
- grade metal system (like aluminum or stainless steel micro
- mesh) will typically offer superior performance and peace of mind.

Assess your specific needs, budget, and local climate before making your final decision.
