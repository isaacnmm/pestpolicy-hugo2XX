They come out at night to feed, making it difficult to spot them unless you know where to look. Understanding their hiding habits is crucial for detecting them during the day.

Bed bugs often hide in these areas because they are close to their food source.

- **Cracks and Crevices: **Inspect furniture, baseboards, and walls for cracks where bed bugs can hide. - **Upholstered Furniture: **Bed bugs may hide in the cushions and seams of chairs, sofas, and other upholstered furniture. - **Electrical Outlets: **Bed bugs can squeeze into electrical outlets and other small openings in walls. - **Behind Wall Hangings: **Posters, paintings, or pictures hung on walls can provide hiding spots for bed bugs.
