In this post, I've reviewed this PIRANHA Wipe N Spray which is among the *best fly spray for horses. *

Flies will particularly be rampant during the months of summer particularly with areas that experience hot summers and mild winters. With this Pyranha [Fly Spray](https://pestpolicy.com/espree-aloe-herbal-fly-repellent-horse-spray-review/),you can easily control the flies and bugs attacking your horse. Definitely, with its conspicuously yellow bottle, its easy to identify this horse product even in your local store.

I have to reveal that I first tested this [horse fly](https://pestpolicy.com/ecosmart-organic-horse-fly-knockdown-repellent-review/)spray after I saw very many horse owners with the yellow bottle during different shows.

##  Pyrethrin-based fly spray

It is a pyrethrin-based fly spray which makes it's super effective. In addition, it comes with lanolin (with high sheen), an ingredient thatll leave your horses coat shining amazingly. This lanolin acts like the coat conditioner while the spray also has a citronella scent. Therefore, recently when I attended a horse show, I didnt require to purchase an additional horse product for extra shine.

##  Ergonomic bottle design

You can use a towel of mitt for the horses face or just spray all over the other parts of the animals body. In addition to having the gallon refill options, this fly spray has an ergonomic bottle designs thats easy to hold and use.

Next up, just moisten the soft cloth you have using the PYRANHA Wipe N Spray Fly and finally rub it over the horses hair make sure your wiping strokes are going against the animals hair growth. 3.

Its important to ensure you seriously spray critical areas such as shanks, shoulders, and legs in addition to giving the animals face area the required attention. **Spraying ** 1. On spraying the PYRANHA Wipe N Spray, youll need to create a mist of the product that will reach the critical areas of the horse. 2. However, avoid spraying horses face since it could affect its eyes therefore youll need to use the wiping method above. 3.

In addition, you must not we the skin of your horse and must not go over 2 oz. for every fly spray application.

##  **Why I love this PYRANHA Wipe N Spray Fly**

1. Well, this PYRANHA Wipe N Spray truly kills fleas, gnats, mosquitos in addition to other dominant insects that tend to attack horses. Definitely, with this spray I dont have to re-spraying my horse since it will actively control the flies for about 1 week. 2. After using the spray I noticed that my horse immediately tends to become less irritable with lesswagging of its tail.

Luckily, this formula controls/ repel more than just the flies that you were initially targeting.

3. The fly spray will not irritate your horses skin. Further, its cost-effective as youll require less number of spray re-applications. However, you must not wet the horse. 4.

##  The downsides of this**PYRANHA Wipe N Spray Fly**

Despite all the love I have for this spray, below I outline some of the cons I experienced (this is for total transparency). For dirty, sandy, or dusty areas, you might find out that upon applying the fly spray, dirt could s stick on your horse. Therefore, if youre in a horse show, you might require to constantly need to wipe your horses skin.

Second, some horse owners may not like the smell (the strong citronella scent we discussed earlier) of this PYRANHA Wipe N Sprayproduct.

However, this is not the case with all of us out here the best you can do is to test it as you night also love the citronella scent like myself.
